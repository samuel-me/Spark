Shawn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, marred by some pretty big issues.",Verified Purchase,"I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic ""angry Amazon customer 1-star"" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience."
Tyrone,4.0 out of 5 stars,My Review of the S20 FE,Verified Purchase,Performance = 9 / 10 - fast Snapdragon cpu but only only 6gb ramDisplay = 8.7 / 10 -  120ghz is great  but screen is washed compared to s10/s20Batttery = 8.8 / 10 - all day batteryDesign = 8.7 / 10 -  flat screen but  bezels could be smallerCamera = 9 /10 - great main cameras - selfie camera is MEH and pics can be blurry on moving objectsFeatures = 9/10 - three years of software updates..5g...a lot of color options .. ip68 .. wireless charging .. dex
Jake,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bait & Switch?,Verified Purchase,When I purchased this it was listed as 8gb of ram but the model I received is 6gb. That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.Doesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.I'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5.
J,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible phone in every way.,Verified Purchase,Never again will I buy another Samsung phone.  My Galaxy S8+ is superior in every way except 5G.  This phone reeks internal design contest by 1st year interns.  Goodbye Samsung.
Mitch,1.0 out of 5 stars,Touch screen ghost inputs,Verified Purchase,"Â This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn't affected, but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week."
"Sorry, Not Sorry",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone at a great price,Verified Purchase,"Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two."
Bryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,This phone is AMAZING!!! Ignore bad reviews.,Verified Purchase,"To give some context, I'm coming from a Galaxy S7.FYI, I read some of the bad reviews. Most are widely inaccurate.Pros- Easy setup: I'm on Verizon and all I had to do was swap the sim card. I didn't have to take the phone to store, I didn't have to log in and change settings, etc.- The 120hz OLED screen is game changing (for me). I'm gamer and I could immediately notice how fast and responsive the panel is. Colors are vibrant and blacks are inky inky black.- Processor is light years ahead of S7. It's also running the 20 series flagship processor.- Camera is amazing.  3x zoom and wide lens. Yesss please.- I love the colors. I got the Orange.- Samsung's OneUI is a huge improvement. Very intuitive and very powerful. I've been setting up advanced Bixby routines. I honestly never thought i would use Bixby but I'm a believer now.- Larger screen and battery than the S20- Very fast and responsive finger print scanner- Dual sim cards and up to 1TB of additional storage if you buy a micro sd card. I'm looking at you APPLE. Although Samsung will be removing the sd card storage slot for S21's for some reason.- Comes with a charger. APPLE!Cons- Face recognition is too slow for my liking. The finger print reader is more than adequate.- No 3mm headphone jack- Out of the box charger is not the best. You get a 15 watt charger even though this phone can handle 25 watts.In summary, if you can get this phone for 550 to 600 bucks... BUY IT."
Frugalman,1.0 out of 5 stars,So close! But look elsewhere,Verified Purchase,"This phone seemed like it had it all for an unbeatable price of $550. Big battery, 120 hz, good cameras, recent cpu, and okay ram. Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it, but still have problems with jittery scrolling, accidental touches, etc. This isn't something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere, or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums). I don't mean to be a downer but I strongly advise to choose a different phone. I'm still looking myself. Good luck!"
Genestoy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verizon would not activate,Verified Purchase,Took the phone to a Verizon store as soon as I received it and after 30 minutes of the rep trying to activate it he called Verizon tech support and was told the phone had no registered ESN and could not be activated on their network. The phone also appeared to have been used as it had scratches in the end and was missing the sim card key. Am returning the phone.
stardewkitteh,1.0 out of 5 stars,120hz screen has issues,Verified Purchase,"The screen on this phone will randomly stop accepting touch inputs and then at other points it will click when trying to scroll or scroll up when lifting your finger. Looking at online forums, this seems to be a common problem with this particular phone from Samsung. Seems like they tried to cut some corners to get the price down while still advertising the 120hz display and it didn't work out well. Not sure if it's something that can be fixed with a software update but it wasn't corrected as of the October 2020 OTA update. Not going to chance waiting around for a fix and being outside the return window. If you are experiencing odd behavior with your screen and touch sensitivity, you're not alone. Bummer as well because otherwise I loved the phone."
Pauly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the processor and camera!,Verified Purchase,I sold my s20 ultra and bought this. No issues so far everything works great. I now have extra money to buy something else.
Karen33,1.0 out of 5 stars,Major Touch screen issue!,Verified Purchase,"Found out my phone also has the touch screen issue others are complaining about. Tested it with Touch Screen Test app, instruction is on Youtube. Two finger swipe causes criss-cross pattern. Jittery and unresponsive swipe action when scrolling through websites. If software issue it can eventually be fixed, but not going to wait around to find out that it's a hardware issue. Returning the phone after one hour of use. Guess Samsung cut a critical corner while trying to reduce the cost of the FE version."

TOP 500 REVIEWER
",TOP 500 REVIEWER,"very good phone for the price, Samsung bloatware is easier to deal with than in past years",Verified Purchase,"Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600, it is a very good deal for the price.The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range, but it is still more than enough for most people.The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case, you won't even notice the plastic back.The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support ""USB-C PPS"" mode and are UL Certified.The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer."
Stephen D Pearl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, a (quality) Samsung phone to compete with OnePlus. (Early review - Purchased @ TMobile)",Verified Purchase,"I've been a OnePlus fan for years. I've owned a OnePlus 3, 6, and (currently) a 7t. They've always been solid phones at a solid price, undercutting the bigger players with nearly-flagship specs at mid-range prices.So why did I even consider the Samsung S20 FE if I'm so happy with the 7t?Well, I have to confess. I'm getting a $500 TMobile trade-in value on an old Google 3a I had laying around. $199 net for a brand new Samsung S series phone? Well that was too enticing not to consider.Then there's this. I wanted a true wide-angle lens and better optical zoom. For as much as I love my 7t, I've been longing for something with a little more versatility and quality in the camera stack. (Yeah, I take a lot of pictures.) The 7t's wide-angel lens isn't all that wide and the telephoto is about 1.7x, not 2x or even 3x.So if I wanted a better camera setup, why not go for one of the other S series with higher res sensors and longer zooms? Because the rest of the S20 line was out of my price range. I wanted better cameras, but I'm not insane. $1300 for the S20 Ultra and it's 4x zoom? No way. $1400 for the Note 20 Ultra with it's 5x zoom? Nuts.$699 (with MAJOR trade-in incentives) for a Samsung S20 FE with specs to rival the OnePlus 8?Now *that* was worth a look.I'm glad I looked. This may be the first time I walk away from OnePlus and land on Samsung. The jury is still out, and this is still an early review (I've only had the phone for a couple of days), but so far I'm duly impressed.Now I won't belabor pixel peeping comparisons between the various phones. Pop over to Youtube and you can find comparisons between just about every phone on the market. What I will say is simply this. For $699 the Samsung S20 FE compares extremely favorably to the OnePlus 8, not to mention the rest of the phones in the Samsung S series.So what follows is a quick rundown of the good, the bad, and the meh. I don't think there's really anything ""ugly,"" just a little ""meh.""The Good...* I've never been a fan of the Samsung ""Edge"" style screen. I always turn it off. The S20 FE has a nice, flat, vibrant screen. You get Samsung screen brilliance in a no edgy gimmicks, 6.5"" form factor. Nearly bezel-less. Oh yeah, and it does 120hz, but for battery life purposes I've dialed mine back to 60hz. I'm not a big gamer and frankly 60hz works for me.* The performance is perfectly acceptable. I've seen benchmarks that indicate Samsung isn't squeezing every ounce of power out of the Qualcomm 865, but I don't have any complaints. I can load up everything I typically run and never encounter a slow-down. (Browser, password manager, camera, news feeds, social media, etc.)* The battery life has been good so far, and I expect it to get a little better after it breaks in and Android does it's app tuning magic. I just finished my second day with about 30% left in the tank after a typical usage cycle; a TON of web browsing, a couple of Youtube videos, some social media, LOTS of messaging, a couple of calls.* <drumroll> The cameras are surprisingly solid for a phone at this price point. The 12mp wide angle sensor is poppy and vibrant with TONS of detail. It's a bona-fide wide-angle, too, unlike my OnePlus 7t that trims a few mm off the angle. The 12mp main sensor is well matched to the wide angle, producing nearly identical exposures and saturation, with plenty of detail. Sure, everyone's crazy about megapixels, but 12m is plenty for most applications and I've printed 12mp shots up to 20x30 in the past with good success. Now, the 8mp 3x optical telephoto is worth a special note. Yes, 8mp is a tad skimpy, but when you consider that other phones in the Galaxy S range (and other manufacturers) use a combination of pixel binning and AI magic to artificially create longer zooms, 8mp 3x optical is... well, it's workable. So far the results are not only usable, but quite good. At 10x the results are still usable, though I wouldn't use them for blow-ups. At 20x, detail is dropping off fast, far earlier than the ""space"" zoom on the higher end Galaxy S20 line with their higher resolution sensors. By 30x the photos are unusable for anything but... well, they're unusable. At this price point, though, the quality is quite good and I have no complaints. I'm paying half the cost versus the other Samsungs with more advanced zoom setups, so I'm getting about what I expect at this price. Oh yeah... I don't do selfies. YMMV ;) BTW... The camera software launches *faster* than the module on the Note 20 Ultra. No kidding. The bargain unit is faster than the flagship. Noticeably. Like a second or two faster. Go figure.* Memory Card slot. Why can't Apple give you expandable memory? No memory expansion on the OnePlus. Why couldn't Samsung add it to the $799 Note 20? The S20 FE has it at $699. Winning!* Oh yeah, and one bennie... I know a lot of people go bluetooth and live audio isn't as big a deal anymore. I happen to be one of those folks who likes to listen to live audio off my phone. I carry it around with me. The OnePlus 7t has always been a bit tinny for my taste, another minor annoyance. The audio on the S20 FE is actually passably rich and full. ""Passably."" This is no Bose Soundbar. It's just not annoying. ;)The Bad* Slower charging than the OnePlus 8. Come on, Samsung. You can do better than 25w charging. How can tiny little OnePlus keep beating you to the technology punch on charging?* Plastic back. Some people don't like this. I'm fine with it. I put my phones in Spigen slim cases anyway. But if you're spoiled by all-glass backs, this isn't going to win you over.* Samsung One UI. Bloatware. Irrelevant. Childish looking. Replace it with Nova Launcher, tune it to your taste, and move on. OnePlus has a clean, crisp UI and that's the way it should be. Samsung needs to grow up and get rid of One UI.* 6gig of RAM? Come on, Samsung. OnePlus routinely puts 12gig in. Now I don't need 12gig, and I've never pushed my phone to those limits, but please, it's time to grow up and beef up the RAM, even at this price point.The Meh* 5G performance is good when you can find it, but it crushes battery life. I never run it on anything but 4G. I don't need 5G. I'm not streaming 8k to my phone. I'm just using it for the typical stuff people use a smartphone for.* Please, for the love of the UNIVERSE, kill BIXBY! Bixby, Bixby, Bixby! KILL BIXBY! In the age of the Google Assistant and Alexa, it's utterly, completely useless. Why tie Bixby to a button? KILL IT! UGH!* Who puts volume buttons on the right? Seriously. If you want to create a phone for righties, the volume buttons should fall under the index finger, not the thumb. The power button goes under the thumb, as it is on this phone. This is a bizarre design choice and OnePlus gets it right. Samsung, not so much.* One thing OnePlus continues to add to their phones that nobody else on the Android side has added is a volume mute slider. I can't tell you the number of times that silly little slider has come in handy during meetings. Flip a switch. No need to open the screen. Just slide the switch. Steal the idea, Samsung. (Correction, just take inspiration from it. :) )Bottom line...This phone is a GREAT value for the price. At this price point it's in the same league as the OnePlus 8 and in some subtle ways it's a notch better. The only reason anyone would spend any more money than this would be to get gimmicks and pointless performance bumps. Save your money. Make it a Galaxy S20 FE or a OnePlus 8."
Danny C,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap-o phone for sure, but still alright",Verified Purchase,"I ordered this phone when Amazon said 8gb of ram... Showed up with 6gb, and now the site has been corrected. Good phone though! The front-facing camera has a little silver ring around it that makes it super noticable, and the phone seems to get pretty hot due to the plastic back, but otherwise I'm pretty impressed with this thing."
Wesley Wood,1.0 out of 5 stars,Screen is unresponsive many times,Verified Purchase,I ordered this phone and had high hopes that it would be what I had hoped for. This phone's screen on numerous occasions has stopped working or would randomly open apps when trying to scroll. This phone is very disappointing.
Erick C,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is it. The best phone money can buy without spending $1000+.,Verified Purchase,"**UPDATE 10/18/21**If you're thinking about the S21, stick with this phone. After a year of owning the S20FE, this phone is still great and performs perfect. I still love it.Last time I owned a Samsung phone was back in the TouchWiz days of the note 2. Since then for me it's been motorola and Google, but I decided to give Samsung a try again. I am so glad I went with this phone over the Pixel 5. At the time, the s20 FE was $100 cheaper than the pixel 5 and the reviews across youtube sold me on this phone. Having owned the G7 power and G power, having the extra battery life is important to me. At first I tried the A71 5G but it felt incomplete. I was not impressed with the build quality or the cameras, even the battery did not last despite being the same capacity as the s20 fe. I am so glad I returned the A71 5G and got this one just a few weeks later. I was not planning for samsung to announce this phone at all. Easily worth the extra $100. It feels more premium, and I prefer the matte finish on the S20 FE compared to the A71. The cloud white is so nice and universal, with hints of aura glow depending on the lighting. It has the finish to that of a CD. But as far as battery, out of the box with 48 percent I've been using the phone nonstop for a little over 2 hours now and I'm down to 27. That's pretty impressive considering the battery isn't fully calibrated. The One UI is great, the 120hz screen is super smooth and responsive and that SD 865 performance is very nice as well. The phone can keep up with me easily. Despite the lack of the headphone jack, I think the pros outweigh the cons. The screen, the build quality, the battery and the audio quality is very nice. 5G connectivity is fast with T-Mobile and the fact this phone supports wifi 6 capability, this phone is definitely future proof. This may be the start of something Samsung can move forward with. A premium device with flagship specs for less. I will definitely update the review as I have more time with the phone and upload some sample photos but as it is now, a solid 5 stars from me. You can't go wrong for $599.99. Flagship specs for a cheaper price, Samsung definitely got it right with the S20 FE. I can totally recommend. I'll definitely be sticking with this phone for a while, especially considering Samsung promised this phone 3 years of updates.*Update 1/21/2021*I've had the phone for a few months now and I just still love it as much as the first day I got it, the new One UI 3, android 11 update is definitely welcomed, the camera is still taking phenomenal pictures, and the battery is still holding up.  I was contemplating trading it in for the S21, but I think this phone is much better for what you get at the price it's offered."
imxkal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Problems problems problems,Verified Purchase,"Bought one from best buy with hardware version 1.0 and an another with hardware version 1.1. Bought a 3rd one from amazon and I have to save all three units have the same issue.Pros-Battery life-Snapdragon 865-Size-WeightCons- Touch screen issues. Even after three firmware updates, samsung can't seem to fix the problem.- Black crush issue. This is visible on all 3 of my units. Ended up returning all 3.- Android auto and bluetooth constantly disconnect. Tried samsung, oneplus, xiaomi, and lg cables and all seem to disconnect. I never had android auto or bluetooth disconnect on my older android devices."
Yuyan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but it's not dual sim,Verified Purchase,"Don't buy it if you want a dual sim phone!!I bought it on Amazon since I saw it supports dual sim in customer questions. Turns out it doesn't work and wastes a whole day of mine to figure it out. Maybe the esim will work but I don't want to spend more time on this.It's a good product, but Amazon makes it hard to enjoy it."
Ezana Berhanu,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value, totally worth it.",Verified Purchase,"Just ordered my phone it came super quick at a discount from Amazon. For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it."
Quantum TV,1.0 out of 5 stars,MASSIVE Downgrade from S9!,Verified Purchase,"Cheap plastic backing, HORRIBLE 407 ppi, UGLY reds, poor screen quality overall, no headphone jack, downgraded power supply (used to be glossy with nice, visible grey lettering), no headphones included, sluggish fingerprint reader, and genuinely the most DISGUSTINGLY cheap Samsung galaxy S series phone I've ever had! Even my S6 is more premium! This is what happens when you let influencers glow about everything, without calling the downgrades out! I've never been so disappointed in a product. What a nasty joke of a Samsung S series. This is NOT a quality phone in any aspect that counts. I hate it. I do not reccomend buying this. Coming from the S9, this is a MAJOR downgrade and I'm furious about it."
Mike,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good,Verified Purchase,"Just received the S20 FE today.  Im switching over from the original Pixel XL. Wasnt thrilled enough with the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G lineup/availability. So I thought I would give this one a shot.  Overall its been a good first day with the phone.I popped in my Verizon sim card and after setup (see below) I immediately had cell service and 4G connectivity. No problems there.Setup was kinda a pain switching from a Google phone. I had my old phone backing up to Google drive. The setup process didnt quite help make a full transfer. It pulled in my contacts and app data, but didnt reinstall my play store apps automatically or transfer my SMS/call history. What I ended up doing was using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I installed it on my old/new device and it transferred every thing.  Contacts, SMS/call history, app data, photos, videos, etc. It even started automatically installing my missing apps. That was nice.Performance wise the phone feels pretty snappy and has a nice display.  I havent had a chance to play with the camera yet. Today was just 'get the phone up and running"" day.My biggest issue is not with the phone itself but with the the original listing on Amazon when I purchased the phone a few days back. It said the phone had 8GB of RAM.  That was a selling point for me.  When I booted up the phone I check the settings and it says 6GB. I came back into this phones listing in Amazon and wouldnt you know, now it says the phone has 6GB of RAM. Hmmm... That kinda ticked me off. But not the phones fault."
Just wanted a new phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't match the description,Verified Purchase,"I just got the S20FE today and it looks pretty good so far, but the description on Amazon is pretty inaccurate.This does NOT have 8gb RAM, only 6gb. This has been updated in the description now, but not when I bought it. Additionally, it does NOT come with the AKG headset which the description still says should be included. So if you don't have Bluetooth headphones, you're out of luck, or will still need to go buy a pair.Customer service also did not help, the only solution is to return for a refund. I still need the phone so that's not a solution. All I wanted was for all the parts in the description to come."
Caledonia Bergeron,2.0 out of 5 stars,The elephant in MY room,Verified Purchase,"What nobody anywhere is talking about and I wonder whyI wonder if I am more sensitive to this as I upgraded from a quite old Note 4 that I had rooted and was running mostly aftermarket apps on. But when I ""upgraded"" to this phone I was blown away by the staggering amount of bloatware and intrusive apps pre installed on this phone. The BIGGEST by far being Samsungs own software, it is everywhere! It has it's hands in everything and if you take the time to look through at all the permissions on this software it is staggering how much information about you it is allowed to collect.Now we all know that having a smartphone means some loss of privacy and that companies use the selling of certain information to offset the cost of the devices they are selling you. I understand that. But, again....maybe it's just me but I am not OK with the level at which they force this down your throat and the amount of preinstalled and (can not be removed or actually stopped) apps that have full permissions to ALL of your information.Yes it's a good phone, it should have a bit more ram for what it is, I like the SD card expansion slot ( I can't believe that has to be said) Snappy processor and camera is OK at best. I really expected more from what should have been Samsungs near flagship device for the time. Price seems to be going up again for some reason as well. When I bought mine in Febuary of 2021 it was 599 from Amazon themselves."
fak13638,2.0 out of 5 stars,SHAME on Samsung for this 'budget' phone!,Verified Purchase,"Nothing 'Budget' about the price on this phone and yet they still found a way to justify REMOVING high use features that have been available to their 'faithful' users for YEARS on previous models.

Thanks Samsung/Sprint for providing a substandard product with the release of the S20 FE 5G."
atomic240,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why you should consider buying this phone, and what the reviewers fail to mention.",Verified Purchase,"This is a fantastic phone.  I bought this phone before it became available on Amazon at Best Buy, but I thought potential buyers would be interested in these attributes of the Samsung 21 FE.Positives (in no particular order):1) Excellent camera.  It takes night pictures with a quality that is almost beyond belief.  Yes, the night mode takes a little while to process, but it is quite worth it.  I was able to capture an image that had stars visible in the image.  I've never had that on a cell phone.  The daytime images are comparable to the iPhone 13, which are quite good.  Something the reviewers fail to mention with the camera is the Field of View, which is 79 degrees, or equivalent to around 26.5 mm, full frame, which is just a tad narrower than the iPhone 13, and quite a bit narrower than the s21 ultra which is around 24 mm, and the s22 ultra which is reported at coming in at 23 mm, with a FOV of 86 degrees.  This is not acceptable as this will lead to significant distortion when taking pictures of people at closer range with the main camera.  It may be possible to correct through algorithms using the AI, but the subjects will always be smaller. It seems there is a trend toward having much wider lenses on the main camera which doesn't really make sense considering there are ultra wide lenses on most of these phones. I fear this may be the last flagship grade Samsung to have a FOV as narrow as 79 degrees on the main lens with this level of quality.2) Thermal throttling.  Yes, this is actually an advantage.  The Snapdragon (SD) 888 was know to run hot, and the SD 8 Gen 1 is even hotter.  Most people do not need that type of bleeding edge of performance. This phone actually runs quite cool. Most people don't want their phone to turn into a frying pan in order to squeak out an extra bit of performance, and if they do, then they will get a proper gaming phone like an Asus ROG.3) Battery life.  I've seen conflicting reviews concerning battery life. Some reviewers see more that adequate battery life, while others find it lacking. Personally, I find battery life excellent with this phone.4) Aspect ratio and associated size. This phone has an aspect ration of 19.3:9. This is excellent news for those that find that phones have gotten too long and skinny making them difficult to be placed in a pocket or a purse.  Not to mention, most content is still 16:9, which is more enjoyable to use on this aspect ratio.  Very few reviewers will cover this.5) Excellent signal reception as per typical Qualcomm excellence with their radios.6) Many more updates available through Android 15 and a years worth of security updates beyond that.  The S20 FE will only have till Android 13 and 1 year of security updates beyond this. This is increasingly important from a security perspective.This phone is not perfect, though, as indicated below:1) Weak haptic motor.  Haptic motor is not very strong on this phone.2) People mention lack of glass back.  I'm not sure how relevant this is as 90% of people buying this phone will put a case on it, myself included. I don't care about the plastic back on this phone. Looks fine to me.3) Price. This is a big one for a lot of people.  Many compare it to the Pixel 6.  Yeah, on paper that may work, but in the real world, the Pixel 6 is so buggy, it is difficult to use for many.  In addition, the signal reception has been found to be lacking in the Pixel 6.  A phone, no matter how well spec'd, is useless without a good signal.  So, take the Pixel 6 out of your price comparison.  That, being said, the price is still a little high, but there are many promotional offers on the phone now.4) Missing headphone jack and sd card slot.  This is a disappointing thing for many, myself included, but the positive attributes outweigh this."
Elle,1.0 out of 5 stars,Full of bloatware,Verified Purchase,"I got this phone about a week ago and it's been frustrating to say the least. The fingerprint sensor is very hit or miss, mostly miss. I've already had to reprogram my fingerprints. The touchscreen doesn't always register. The program is full of bloatware. So much space is used by proprietary garbage apps that you can't delete. When I swipe down the alerts at the top there are advertisements! There aren't many settings on the keyboard. This whole interface is just annoying. I came from the Pixel 2 which was very easy to use, no bloatware. Just free and empty, lots of settings. I should have gone w/my gut and bought the Pixel 5."
Kevin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Touch screen issues!,Verified Purchase,"If you play mobile games that require a lot of tapping and swiping from both fingers, stay away from this phone. The phone registers ghost taps during rapid finger movements between two fingers which creates a dragging effect. It's very noticeable in first person shooter games where your character will suddenly look at a different, unintended direction.It remains to be seen if this can be solved via software updates. Samsung already tried (i have the latest patch) and the problem still persists. If they can't patch it within my return period, it's going back.Other than that, yes you get flagship specs at a midrange phone price."

Jay Jay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Cloud Mint!,Verified Purchase,"I had my previous phone, a Huawei Mate 9  for 3 years (ordered from Amazon), and I felt it was time for an upgrade. After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G, I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me, it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far, everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange, but I had to go with my favorite color, Cloud Mint.The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone, the bright light is a little blinding, especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.For the battery life, it seems that it doesn't last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G, I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos, using social media, surfing the internet, etc.), I would have to charge it after a day, but with the Mate 9, I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn't allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen, which I'm bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!Included in the box: phone, charging adapter, charging cable, paperwork, and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones, but it's not a big deal. I'll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds, but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.When I received my package and I opened it up, it came with ZERO packaging, which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box. Amazon, please make sure the package is secured well so the product we are paying $$$ for arrives safely."
Jesus,5.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable; just right screen size,Verified Purchase,"I upgraded from a Galaxy S8. I love the bigger screen size. I miss the physical thumbprint on my old phone, but the on-screen one on the S21FE is very responsive. After reading about all the issues people have had with the Pixel 6, I was wary. This phone exceeded my expectations. It is very responsive and the screen size is just right. For my older eyes I can read well, and will just fit in my back pocket [inside of a Spigen case].The sound is good as I place calls on speakerphone or listen podcasts while I mull around the kitchen.The battery is average, it is great that it can be charged wirelessly since having it in my jacket pocket while I cycle I get condensation and would not be able to charge it with a cable until it fully dries.I set my refresh screen to 60Mhz to save some battery and the scrolling is still smooth.To nitpick, it would be nice to have a SD card slot when I want to shoot a lot of pics or bring extra lectures (videos) to watch at my leisure.The modem has been great and I have been getting speeds of 300Gbps in Chicago (Metro by T-Mobile)I am very happy with this phone and think the icing on the cake was that it will get 4 android versions. I normally keep my phones until they give the ghost."
Jesse Ryan Peterson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Verified Purchase,"Had the regular s21, and it was all right. Screen broke do to my on negligence. So I seen to s21 fe on Amazon for a good price. Everything on the FE is better fingerprint scanner face recognition and it's faster even though it's got six gigs of RAM instead of eight. I love it!!"
GMP57,5.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung S20 FE 5G phone is outstanding!,Verified Purchase,"The Samsung has 20 at the 5G is the best value for the money.I upgraded from a Motorola G7 to this Samsung S20 5G unlocked.  My carrier is Verizon Wireless. All I had to do was install a new SIM card and this phone works beautifully. I am able to get 5G where available and it took me awhile to become familiar with Samsung apps but now I really like using Samsung apps instead of Google apps.But I'm amazed of how hard it is to learn a different ecosystem. I almost sent the phone back because I was under the impression that I needed the Google apps that I was used to using.Thankfully I hung in there and learned something new.Samsung makes great hardware and software. Samsung is going to give competition to the to the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.Each phone company wants you to use their apps and it took me a month or two to get used to this because at first I thought they're forcing me to use their apps. I don't want bloatware, but as I became familiar with Samsung apps they work flawlessly with their products.The other thing  is the camera on this Samsung is outstanding and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Samsung has hooked me.The phone also works flawlessly with the Samsung Galaxy watches.Excellent customer service and support."
Noe Lopez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Big bang for your buck,Verified Purchase,"This phone is solid. It's interesting that in 2020, a ""budget"" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren't as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less than  ideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I'm not on my phone a lot, I easily get 2 days and squeeze  in a few hours from the next day if I really can't get to another charger. If I have a day off and I'm on the phone for hours,  I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent.The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it's hit or miss sometimes. I have found that  if I pay attention to where I place my finger, it tends to recognize it more easily.  I just never thought I'd miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing.  The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you're coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker, you' enjoy them.. Definitely  get a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I'm finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a rickety sort of way. To their credit, they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don't expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20s. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale, it's a no brainer and very easy to recommend."
T. Sen,1.0 out of 5 stars,one star,Verified Purchase,"phone is discounted for price and quality.I have this phone almost for two months now, having a lot of issues on the screen.Never had fingerprint reading issues including old versions of galaxy phones. Screen is garbage.if you use drawing app you will see screen misses lots of touching points when you are drawing something. Also it registers lines which you didn't make.Also unlocking with fingerprint is a nightmare. 70% of the time it doesn't recognize my fingerprint and I have to type my password after five failed entries.Camera is taking the worst photos with not so great coloring and kind of blurry images.Especially with the front camera I was never able to take good picture quality since it is fixed focus.This is the worst phone I have ever has as Samsung.so unhappy with it. and returning it.Not recommended at all!"
T Crosby,1.0 out of 5 stars,"USED Phone, NOT NEW!!!!",Verified Purchase,"This phone is supposed to be NEW!!! As you can see in the photos, when I opened the box it was dusty inside and you can't see but there's a fingerprint on the screen. Also, you can see a sim card was activated on March 8th and I received the phone on April 4th. Also, whomever had it before had 50 pages open on the internet. I do believe I need to be compensated for getting a USED phone when it was clearly advertised as NEW!!!! I'm considering sending it back! PISSED OFF!!"
Jason Au,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not compatible with AT&T's 5G,Verified Purchase,"I bought this phone the first time, it was not compatible with ATT's 5G. I called ATT and Samsung to confirm that it was not related to settings or IMEI registration. I thought the phone was defective and exchanged for another one. The second phone was not compatible with ATT 5G either. I only get LTE+, which is the faster version of 4G, but not 5G. However, it could be because ATT does not have a real 5G network yet.The phone is fine, although I am quite disappointed that it is not compatible with ATT 5G, which was one of the reasons why I decided to buy this phone."
Al,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,Verified Purchase,"I've by chance had a total of three of these in my family, so have a decent handle on them.  For the specs on paper, it seems a good deal.  But it's a problematic phone.Firstly, build quality is inconsistent.  One was perfect, and two have gaps and overhangs of the back plastic onto the phone.  Second is battery life...for such a large battery, it doesn't feel like it lasts as long as it should.Most importantly...touch screen issues.  Just Google it.  All of ours have it, and it will drive you nuts.  The updates were supposed to help, and did to some extent, but the problem still persists and makes pinch zooming so annoying.  I wouldn't bother with this phone unless its heavily discounted."
polyspecific,2.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy this phone.  As far as I am concerned this phone is a complete piece of trash.,Verified Purchase,"The phone works well as a phone, past the 5G switching not being completely worked out, but that is a carrier issue.  I am a Sprint customer and because of the merger and network confusion my phone thinks a 5/5 Sprint 4G LTE signal is  roaming and tried to grab the 1 bar TMobile signal..Now for the showstopper.  The touch hardware is complete and utter trash.  The October firmware update helped a bit.  The sensor array is in a horizontal/Vertical grid.  If you touch three points on the screen and slide any of those fingers past the same grid line as another finger, it drops the moving touch . 4 out of 10 times, and strobes like a series of taps the other 6. The strobing lasts for 1/10 second or so.  I used developer mode to show touches and can watch the touch just disappear.  Now if I place two fingers on each side of the screen so they're both on the same horizontal plane, and then move a third finger between them it drops touch and then strobes every single time.This really looks like an issue from the early days when companies were struggling to get multi finger gestures to reliably work.  Perhaps Samsung used a design made in 2006-2008 to maximize profits. Shameful.I pre-ordered this phone. I have never preordered any piece of hardware. I did it because ""Samsung knows howmto make a phone. That is one thing they get right, unless it explodes..."".  Well, apparently Samsung forgot how to make a touchscreen screen.... Yes, Samsung.  A screen.  That's your thing... You make screens. You screwed that up like a first time manufacturer.  And then you decided to sell it anyway. You even mentioned ""Games"" in your advertising.This is my third Galaxy S10 FE with this same issue.  Initial phone was Sprint branded (returned), second was unlocked (waited two weeks for more information and spent over an hour on the phone with Samsung, the Requested replacement), replacement phone has same exact issue.  Failing 3/3 of the time... That looks like 1... Yup.  100% failure rate. This is after the October firmware update that was supposed to fix the touch bugs."
Patty Bee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cable included,Verified Purchase,"I was alarmed when I got this phone because the included cable plugged into the phone at both ends of the cord.  Two small plug-ins.  I don't have any adapters that would fit that it make this work as a usb connection.  What I realized later is that my old Samsung charging cord works with it, and that has a usb adaptor that can work in my car.  The included cable is actually supposed to be used to transfer data from your old phone to your new phone!!  How about that?  I didn't use that, but used the QR code the new phone gave me and the bluetooth connection and easily transferred all my data, even before I have gotten a sim card for it.  Bravo, Samsung."
Joshua James Feenstra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Flagship updates, features and speeds, at a fraction of the price! BUT NO CASE SUPPORT!!!!!!",Verified Purchase,"I've had this phone for quite a while now, and am absolutely loving it. I've been noticing amazing battery life (16 hour days of moderate optimized usage), games amazingly (runs Genshin Impact losing about 9-14% per hour), absolutely NO stuttering, and the camera is pretty good too.Things this phone doesnt do as well as the note 20 ultra.Multitasking. If you want to have more than 3 apps open in the background and resuming where you left off, you wont get that here.Camera. There is 30x, but no 100x, zoom (not a big deal for me, but that might matter for you) And it probably isn't QUITE up to par with the pictures in the end.No pen. The s-pen can be very useful, but you wont get it here.There are a few other small things, but this is all the big things I've noticed.CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT!!!!THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO CASE SUPPORT!!!!!If none of these things are deal breakers, GO BUY THIS PHONE! ITS AMAZING!"
M S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Scam! Refurbished phone!,Verified Purchase,"Refurbished ripoff. Says new and is not. The screen cover to peel off is for an iphone, missing the phone key for the sim slot. Came out of box dusty. Not unlocked. Complete scam and now I have to wait to get my money back."
Paige Tusieseina,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, horrible front facing camera",Verified Purchase,"I really love this phone! I just switched from an iPhone 6s to this by switching out my sim card no problem. You should know that it doesn't come with a cable that will connect an iPhone with this phone, so purchase that beforehand if you want to switch over all of your settings, apps, etc... but you can get them transferred over via icloud.The camera is miles better than my old one, but the selfie, front facing camera is awful. It makes you look like marzipan, like its perpetually stuck on beauty mode. Its frustrating, but I'm not a selfie queen anyway, so I'm not too upset about it. But upset enough to give it 4 stars.This was the first phone I ordered from Amazon and I'm pretty pleased!"
A. Lombardo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Acceptable phone. Won't impress in any way.,Verified Purchase,"This phone was intended to be a considerable upgrade for me. It replaced a 5 year old Nexus 6p. I will not deny that many aspects of it are better. It is undeniably faster. The  modified version of Android, Samsung's One UI, does not impress. It feels like bloat and has made some features harder to find. The through display fingerprint reader feels about 50% as reliable as a rear reader. The area that reads is very small (as is the area on a back reader), but there is no physical surface feature to help you put your finger in the correct position. Most annoying to me is the lack of a headphone jack. I bought the phone knowing I'd give that up, but I assumed the only penalty of the usb-c to heaphone adapter would be the cost of purchasing one. The sound quality is far inferior through an adapter as compared to my previous phones with standard headphone jacks. Additionally using the adapter off of the power input port (usb-c) means your headphone cord comes out the bottom of the phone which is more annoying that I would have thought."
JWJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ah, politics...",Verified Purchase,"This is a beautiful, capable, reasonable smartphone, but the particular one I received would not charge on my third-party wireless charger, either with or without the Samsung silicone case. I ordered a 15 W Samsung wireless charging stand, but that failed in the same manner, Attempts to get help from Samsung's support organization resulted in an erroneous conclusion that the 15W charger did not support the S20 series of phones, but the newer 9W version did, so I ordered the 9W charger...and got the same results. I concluded that the problem had to be with the QI system within the phone, and initiated a return procedure to Amazon, intending to request a simple 'return and replace with identical item', but that option was not available for the phone. Amazon indicated that to speed up the process, I should chat with their specialists before simply returning the phone for credit. After a one-hour 'chat' with Amazon technical help, who finally transferred me to Samsung technical help, who spent another hour before they concluded that I should take the phone to a Samsung-approved service center, which is 2.5 hours away, with no assurance that they could resolve the problem; even less probability they could resolve the problem in the same day...I processed the standard return-to-Amazon-for credit application. Then with a confirmation that the return was approved, I simply ordered another (identical) phone. On it's arrival, I quickly transferred all app, data, etc from the old phone to the new phone, swapped the SIM carrier (containing the SIM card and the external memory card). The new phone charges easily and quickly on both Samsung wireless chargers, even with the Samsung cover on the phone. Using the straight-forward Amazon process is simple and efficient, but when people get involved, the efficiency is subject to total loss, simplicity is gone, and patience becomes a victim."
Eric B,1.0 out of 5 stars,AT&T and Samsung both said it is a Dual Sim phone. It is not.,Verified Purchase,"AT&T shut off both of my numbers for the Ulefone Note 9P. That is a great phone with working Dual Sims, looong battery life, and expanded memory. The didn't tell me they were shutting off my device they just did it. After a back and forth, I learned the Ulefone company is not partnered with AT&T, so they were rejecting their unlocked devices in the U.S. I went to the AT&T store, and I was told the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G would work with dual Sims on the AT&T network. They didn't  have any on stock other than the display that features two sim slots. I checked Samsung  online and it also advertised  the dual sim US functionality.  Finally, I came to Amazon and I purchased it after verifying the dual physical sims. It cost me $634 with tax. My Ulefone that worked great cost $120-$130 also on Amazon. I was willing to pay 5 times more for a slightly less powerful phone because of AT&T's stance on non partner unlocked phones and Samsung and AT&T's verifying  this was a Dual sim capable  product. After receiving it, I used AT&T's social media support to re-activate my line via a phone call. They said they didn't do the dual sim support and ended the call. After spending a couple hours transferring  everything  - apps, passwords,  pics, etc. - I finally reached Samsung chat support. After I submitted picture evidence  that it has 2 sim slots, Samsung came clean. They don't release the software for dual sims in the U.S. (because carriers don't want it I've learned), BUT they said that they will release the feature update ""soon."" When is soon? ""Soon.""If Samsung and the distributor advertisements here on Amazon wouldn't have misrepresented this phone, i wouldn't have purchased it. They want me to send back a device for a refund, now, that has all my personal and business info loaded on it with no option for me to have a working  device.Let this be a warning  for those who don't read sub threads of sub threads about tech, and just believe the manufacturer (Samsung), carrier (AT&T), and distributor (Amazon) won't openly misrepresent and lie to rob you.The battery on this is relatively weak, the memory  is comparatively weak, and IT'S  NOT DUAL SIM  FUNCTIONAL."
Kristina M,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent, it Depends on Your Priorities",Verified Purchase,"I ended up returning this phone. Itâs a really good phone but I just personally didnât like how lightweight it felt and how large it was, or that the case was plastic. Itâs a very beautiful color though. My biggest complaint is the camera quality. I am an artist and I just need my pictures to be perfect, I use the iPhone SE 2nd gen and in my opinion the camera on it is much better. The S20 FE camera is a bit lighter, a bit less saturated, and almost...grainy? I only notice when I zoom in on fine pencil lines etc. but Iâve heard other reviews complaining of the same differences. Anyway, if you want a feather light, huge, very pretty phone with a pretty good but not perfect camera, this phone is okay. Just not worth $600 to me personally."

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE
",TOP 500 REVIEWER,Love everything about this phone,Verified Purchase,The SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G is my first true flagship phone I have ever bought.  I have been a Motorola user with my last being the Moto 5G Plus.  That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues.  I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone.  Its screen is vibrant and colorful.  Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning.  I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well.  Some complain about the selfie camera.  At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled.  Everything here far surpasses all my expectations.  Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines.  Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent.  This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner.  With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it.  I never got half a day with my Motorola.  I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage.  This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time.  Finally I have a true quality phone and I just love having it and using it.  Highly recommend.
IamConrad,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best phone of 2020!!!,Verified Purchase,"Got this phone (S20 FE) after i used my S9 for almost 3 years. I felt the upgrade after 2 weeks of use ( or even in an lesser time), the s20 fe is not a phone you can easily hold with one hand, the plastic back may seem cheap, but, it grows on you, also it won't break as easily like a glass back. The front camera doesn't disturb you when you are watching videos, movies, pic etc. Gaming, it will run very smoothly. Battery, if the phone starts at 100%, by the end of the day it won't be fully dead (even if you have the 120hz screen, which is like spreading butter on bread, you won't go back to 60hz after using the 120hz).Once you get to play with the phone itself, you will notice this cellphone can compete or even win its sisters like the s20 or the s20 plus (heck it can probably bit the iphone11 just with its extra perks)For the price you get, you won't get rip off. It's nice that you can this phone at an reasonable price and not spend 1k on a phone that can do the same thing.Highly recommend if you want a good Phone and for a great price!!!"
Brandon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better Than The A Series,Verified Purchase,"Overall I like the phone. It's definitely missing basic features like a headphone jack, that I enjoyed on my Samsung Galaxy A52.That being said, the thing with Samsung phones is that the battery could be twice this size and it'll only last as long as the average time of other brands. Samsung has horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware. You can't uninstall them and some you can't remove notifications or stop from running.In general I really like the camera and the screen. You can't get the specs that this phone has for the sale price. It does have smaller cameras but it's about the software and the sensors being used here. I can have a phone with 100+ megapixels and still lack the details that this phone provides. It's why I turned down similar Motorola, Nokia, TCL and other branded phones.I also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at. Truthfully, LG phones blew these Samsung phones out of the water. But hype and brand popularity kept Samsung chugging along while real competition got removed. So now I'm stuck using this phone until another company comes along. But it is a good phone! So no worries there. You just won't have good battery life. Also Samsung phones are notoriously slow chargers, my 5yr old phone charges faster than this thing. I'm talking about older than 2010 speeds. Definitely buy a fast charger! It's needed just to get average speeds."
Shawnee,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy red phone if you have tmobile,Verified Purchase,Do not buy red phone if you have tmobile or sprint it is not compatible! Even though it is in the description that it works with them we went to 3 different tmobile locations and had the issue escalated to find out that the entire line of the red phone are not compatible.  I submitted my refund and they recieved the item on July 2 its now July 14 and I have yet to get my money back.  No response when I sent a message to them either.
Jason Beach,1.0 out of 5 stars,Screen is far too fragile,Verified Purchase,"I like the phone itself. It's snappy and seems to work well (although the fingerprint reader is a little weak). My main complaint is the screen is far too brittle. I bought an s20 fe for both my wife and I and her screen has cracked once, been replaced, cracked again and mine has cracked as well. Both have been in cases with screen protectors and not been subject to abuse. Never had this problem with other phones. Sad because other wise is a good phone."
Terrance Earle,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dual SIM issues buyer beware!,Verified Purchase,I really love the phone so far! It is pretty nice. The feedback it gives when you type. It is great.The biggest biggest biggest issue is that the OS is bugged. You can not leverage hybrid SIM it just won't allow it.SIM 1 if occupied prevents SIM 2 from identifying its presence. If SIM 1 is unoccupied  SIM 2 works. This is not how it is supposed to work. It is likely the phone needs a firmware fix.I hope Samsung can address this big Oops.
Ghalib,1.0 out of 5 stars,It came with open box ...refurbished phone,Verified Purchase,It came with open box ..im compeletly disappointed ...it seems to be refurbisehed so i had to return it . Besides i checked it out and it appears to be refurbished
A.I.,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best deals today; we got three of them in our family over the past year,Verified Purchase,"I believe, it is one of the best deals available for a new, established brand name, Android phone. My son got one of these first, I got one for myself half a year later, and recently we got one for my wife. The reasons which we like this phone are as follows:1) It still accepts SD cards (newer Samsung phones do not). You can add 256 GB of flash memory for pictures and video for $30. The same upgrade of memory with the latest Samsung phone models would cost you about $200 (they charge at least $100 per 128 GB of built-in flash - a street robbery!). If you need more memory, you can plug in SD card with capacity up to 1 TB. You can store huge number of movies on it.2) It comes with a charger. An extra charger never hurts. This is a slow 15 W charger, but it does its job - charges the phone over about 2-3 hours. I usually leave it plugged in overnight.3) This phone has a very good, for a smart phone, battery life. With active use through the day, the battery comfortably lasts through the day. If the phone used only for phone calls and occasional e-mail checks, the battery will last for two days or longer.4) Cameras work quite well. Resolution is good, image quality is good. The phone has three camers with different focal length, plus front side camera. Perfectly sufficient for all reasonable uses.5) The screen is big, but not excessively huge. The phone is just right size to fit into the hand comfortably.6) We use it on ATT prepaid plan. It is fully compatible with ATT Wireless and is fully supported.7) It is nominally 5G, but this in reality translates into more DRAM and a little better camera and nothing more. There is no true 5G in the U.S. (thankfully - I do not want to carry a microwave source next to my body!). If you go to ATT web page, you will learn that there are three flavors of 5G, the first two of them are nothing but marketing tricks.  AT&T 5G using low-band spectrum reaches more than 277 million people in more than 18,000 cities and towns in the U.S. This is slightly upgraded 4G LTE. There is nothing 5G in it. This is what you get from all major carriers, sold to you as ""5G"". It is just a little bit faster than regular 4G.  AT&T 5G+ using recently introduced C-Band spectrum sits between our other two bands and provides a great combination of ultra-fast speeds and wide geographic coverage. This has very little availability, and it is still not true 5G yet.  AT&T 5G+ using millimeter wave spectrum delivers super-fast speeds and unprecedented performances in high traffic areas including parts of more than 40 cities and more than 40 stadiums and venues. Availability of this is extremely limited in very limited selection of places, pretty much, nowhere.8) All three S20 FE phones in our family so far have been working very well, they are solid, reliable, and well made.The downsides are few. One, I am missing a headphone jack. I have a couple of Boise noise cancelling headphones (no BT) which I would like to be able to connect. With this phone, I need a USB-C to headphone jack adapter to accomplish it. $10 - $15 is not a big deal, but it is very easy to lose.  Second downside, this phone still has that useless, annoying Bixby, but it got less annoying compared to my old phone. Finally, there are very few pre-installed apps and very little work is needed to clean them up.I do not play games on the phone, so I cannot judge if it is good for gaming. Probably, for latest games one needs the newest, fastest phone. For youtube or movies stored on the phone, it works perfectly well.  The screen has good resolution and is silky smooth, at 120 Hz.I am convinced, it is a great phone to get in the Android family, as long as it is available."
Josue Montalvo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best of the S20 in a cheaper(but not worse) package,Verified Purchase,"Best of what the S20 has to offer in a cheaper build. When I say cheap, I mean lower cost and not necessarily bad quality. The plastic back is the best kind of plastic back you will get on a smartphone, definitely worth the price cut. It's actually better since you don't have to worry about it cracking if you drop it. Optical fingerprint scanner is a tad slower than what I'm used to, coming from the S8, but not slow and doesn't always unlock the first time. Battery life is what makes this phone great, lasts all day. I go to bed with about 35 to 45 percent left, go to sleep, wake up the battery has not drained and I charge it up in the morning before work. And with 120hz on all day. Fast screen is also another highlight, so much smoother than my S8. Cameras great, not a professional camera reviewer, go check out reviews on YouTube."
Erick C,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Stylish, robust, modern device. 5G is great.",Verified Purchase,"I was looking forward to the S21 FE. Despite being sandwiched between the S21 and s22, the bang for the buck is there. At retail $699, you'd be better off with the s22 on a deal, pixel 6 / pro, or even last gen s21 plus. The retail price is questionable and I would advise you not to buy at $699 as I did. I had mine since day one. For the S21 FE, it is a gorgeous device, but the battery life is not up to par and I thought it was just my unit until I compared with another. You're only going to average 4-5 hours max SoT, which really isn't stellar given the battery is 4500mah. And that's with light to moderate usage throughout the day, 90 percent brightness, AOD, 5g on at all times. Originally I thought this was tied to an update, but even after the latest security update and update to one ui 4.1, I did experience my device continually getting abnormally hot during just a few minutes of usage and the battery draining significantly. I do not recall my S20 FE having this issue. It does last through the day before needing a top up however. One thing for certain is if you could set the refresh rate to adaptive, I'm sure it would help battery life, but on the S21 FE it's either 60hz or 120. The cameras are great but in my honest opinion the cameras on my 5a are on the same level if not better than making out fine detail and colors seem more natural on the Pixel. The display panel offers rich colors and can get very bright, the speakers are excellent as well. Fingerprint reader works 100 percent of the time even with a screen protector and is reliable. Finally, the software support is amazing with Samsung promising this device to get 3 major Android updates. As I mentioned previously if you just need a phone with 5g, and if you need the latest and greatest though and need something a little more future proof, want something stylish and built very well that can handle your media consumption and social media, pictures, or just want / need Samsung at a lower price, I can recommend this S21 FE. You're honestly not getting much more with the S22 over the S21 FE, most of the great features you can still enjoy at a fraction of the price. If you have the S20 FE, any of the S21 phones, stick with it as this one is not really much of an upgrade. But I will say I recommend the S21 FE with an asterisk and words of caution. Know that there are other options out there around the same price range. If you can get it on a carrier deal or under $550 then it's probably worth it. Samsung just needs to figure a way to optimize the software and battery for this device, no excuse for 4.5 hours SoT with this size of battery. Overall the s21 FE gets a great 4 star rating from me."
Molly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone!,Verified Purchase,"I'm a diehard Android user coming from a Galaxy s7, and I wanted to treat myself to a brand new phone since I haven't been first owner of a phone since probably 2009. I spent months debating between Galaxy s10 or s20 series, but couldn't stomach spending almost a grand on a phone. When I saw this s20 FE was released with all the bells and whistles of the $1000 phone and for a more reasonable price, I had to go for it. The phone came undamaged, no scratches or smudges or anything. The battery life is great. I have a lot of screen time throughout the day, and by the time I go to bed at night I still have within the 70% range of battery left. The cameras are cool, but I haven't had a chance to really mess with the features all that much yet. I love that it works with my wireless charger. The display features are awesome. There are little things you can adjust to really make it your own customized phone. If you are debating on getting this phone, DO IT! It is totally worth the money and you won't be disappointed!"
alzyee,3.0 out of 5 stars,The phone does work but with some notable flaws,Verified Purchase,The phone does work as a smart phone. When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.Auto focus:The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes >5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is >20' away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don't use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.The final result of this is if I'm in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focusFinger Print Sensor:It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don't cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn't turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.Using the Camera kills other apps:I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.Note: Moved to this phone from the S9
Nino Brunori,4.0 out of 5 stars,I guess it all works because it's new,Verified Purchase,Why am I picking stars on features I do not care about.There is no way I am using Face recognition or a Fingerprint reader.I use the phone to call people and answer text messages.My reason for the feedback is that Amazon placed a $700 brand new phone in a box with one little air bubble wrap and the thing is bouncing around.A little common sense would be great.It's an expensive electronic device.  This is exactly why I refuse to buy Hard drives from these people.I bought an 2 extremely expensive FPGA dev boards just to have 1 that I was required to sign for but the other one was where the Amazon box was placed inside a USPS box then sent through regular mail.GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER PEOPLE.There is no reason to connect your Alexa to a dish washer where you focus your energy yet you can't even send high end electronics through the mail without controversy.I have no doubt this review will make it through but hopefully someone will read it and say...hey...Maybe we should look at this.
Colin Guettler-James,2.0 out of 5 stars,Camera Unusable,Verified Purchase,"I've been a Samsung fan and user for a long time and I looked forward to finally upgrading from the galaxy s8 active. I did tons of research and finally chose this galaxy s20fe and dropped the $600 to buy it with excitement.Now that I have it, I'm sad to say that the camera - one of the single most important features of the phone for me - is broken and/or unusable. No trauma, no visible damage, but the lens rattles around if you shake the phone a bit and all of my pictures in the 1x to 3x zoom level come out like the one you see here.The camera has 3 lenses for different zoom levels and only the 1x - 3x zoom range is useless, but that's the most important one.I think Samsung needs to work on the 3 lens design some more as all of their multi-lens phone cameras seen to have problems.Anyway, I'll be attempting to trade this phone back to Samsung toward a galaxy s9 (shame to have to revert to older models for reliability) or some other single-lens camera or selling it as is and buying an iPhone. Haven't decided yet."
DJ GodsOwn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great affordable smartphone,Verified Purchase,"I like this phone for what it is. I am upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S7 that was on it's last legs. Since I need to have a phone for work, I decided to stay with Samsung as I like their hardware more than any other phone I've tried. I work in IT and I can say that the Samsung phones are pretty reliable and fast. This S20 is no different. The screen is nice, large, and vibrant. My apps are opening very quickly and the battery lasts a lot longer than the older one in my S7 was. I highly recommend this phone if you're looking for a good phone with nice camera setup and good screen. Make sure to pickup a case for it and you'll be good to go!"
S. Brady,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything works like its susposed to,Verified Purchase,"When my old Samsung S9 stopped working without warning ( network ) I started looking for a phone.  With the supply shortages around the world this was not as easy as it should have been.  I checked retailers and service providers.  It seemed that they only had black phones available if any.  Did not want a black phone.  I also could not afford the latest, best models.  The S21 had all the latest software and features with a beautiful display.  Data transfer from my old phone was very easy.  New phone is fast.  Of all the features that I was concerned about was the speaker.  As a senior with less than perfect hearing I was very pleased with the volume.  I could hear the phone clearly."
Barb C Blise,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am very happy with my purchase,Verified Purchase,"I was overdue for an upgrade phone.  I usually buy ones that have been out for a couple of years.  But the unlocked price of this phone sparked my interest.  Not many reviews yet, but so far I am pleased.  I Use TracFone and have no regrets.  You get the same service as you do with being a major network customer."
KalvinStein,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the perfect phone(that is not an iphone),Verified Purchase,"I have tried a lot for phones recently. Sony, pixel 5, and s21 ultra.Pixel 5 freezes randomly at times and Bluetooth issues, Sony was just not very good and drained battery life like crazy. I tried giving the Sony two chances because the camera features are nice but it wasn't enough enough to cover the flaws. The s21 ultra was fantastic, but I couldn't justify the price tag. This phone however was the best. 120hz screen makes it feel premium, but hardware is not slow to where to muddied the user experience. The screen is bright, and it's not 4k but you can't tell on a all device. The battery life also lasts so long because the resolution is not high. Samsung's interface is quite nice and it certainly makes using an android phone extremely enjoyable because it doesn't feel cheap like the Sony did. I will never use an iPhone again, and it was hard for me to find a great alternative. I was hesitant on getting a Samsung too because I was in love with Google products up until the pixel 5. However I can say I'm a big fan of Samsung and their phones and will probably keep using their phones given the user experience was unrivaled by any other Android phone. I would highly recommend this phone"
Quileute ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verizon activation was smooth!,Verified Purchase,"I was worried based on some reviews this was difficult to activate.  I did it within 45 minutes of unpacking the device.  I transferred using Smart Switch app, watched YouTube video on how to move sim card from my old phone to my new phone and the new phone works great.  No Verizon calls, no Verizon store.  This was my first cell phone purchase not made directly with Verizon.  I had worries but Amazon has a return policy that made decision easier knowing that was an option if I couldn't figure it out.  No new contract with Verizon is a BIG bonus!"
kyoto8978,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality phone,Verified Purchase,"First time buying a phone that wasn't directly from a carrier before and I was not disappointed. I did run into issues but that was more of my carrier's fault than the actual product. I purposely chose this phone so I can insert a microSD since the new phones today no longer have the slot.I am very happy with my new phone! Easy to set up, I was able to transfer all of my data from my old phone, and I was able to use it that very same day."
Ner0,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great all around phone, disappointing camera and fingerprint reader",Verified Purchase,"Im upgrading from a Note 8 to this so needless to say its a very welcome upgrade overall except for a few things. Battery life is much better considering how old my Note 8 is. Screen is a downgrade as its only 1080 over my 1440 but still great for what it is. The fingerprint reader is a double edged sword for me. Coming from a note 8, the position of the reader is an upgrade (the reader on the note is on the rear of the phone) but its reliability is iffy. Sometimes itll recognize immediately and other times it takes it a while to recognize it. This is a common issue documented elsewhere as well but not a deal breaker. The biggest issue for me is the camera. While the camera is better than the note 8s on paper, in the real world im having issues with it. The focus is terrible, especially while using flash. The camera consistently gets confused as to where it needs to focus and flash pictures are completely unuseable. Overall a great phone but decide if what I described is a deal breaker for you"
ShinyTop,2.0 out of 5 stars,Returned This Phone,Verified Purchase,"Phone worked well for a couple hours.  Then started getting message that wireless charging paused.  Would wait for charger, Samsung model, to stop blinking red.  Would try again.  Maybe one time in four it would work.  Took the case off and had the exact same behavior.  Tried my old phone and it worked 100% of tries, so returned S20 FE 5G."
M. J. Sharp,1.0 out of 5 stars,A really disappointing Samsung product,Verified Purchase,"Totally disappointed with this phone. First off no charging brick and only comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable.  Guess they want you to buy a wireless charging pad for $35 to $70 and drag it with you where ever you go. Number 2 disappointment is it has a holder for 2 sim cards but it only uses the number 1 card and the number 2 is only a place holder, it is not a dual sim phone. Number 3, cannot add a micro SD card anywhere for data expansion, guess they want you to buy the more expensive 256 Gb with 8 Gb ram phone rather then providing a Micro SD card holder. And the final deal breaker is that it has very poor 2nd language implementation. When the 2nd language, in this case Thai is set as default language only about 30% if that is changed to Thai and the remaining 70% stays in English. I've had other Samsung and Moto phones where Thai as 2nd language is set as default and close to 95% of the phone is changed. And the problem that is pretty much the same with most Samsung phones is they are stuffed full of useless Samsung apps. Will be returning as paying $650 for this phone at this time is way too much considering what IMHO I don't like about this phone."
Goldie,1.0 out of 5 stars,No cord,Verified Purchase,"It came without an electrical cord. What's up with that? I still can't believe I paid $700.00+ for a cell phone that didn't even come with a plug or cord. This is unquestionably the worse company to deal with. Sent it back and they sent me the same thing back. What? They want me to pay additionally for a cord and plug? Now that is laughable. I bought my son a $200.00 phone and his came with everything including earplugs for goodness sake. Oh and this phone is way, way too sensitive to touch.  Try to google something and whatever you start typing it automatically shows everything starting with that letter or number!!! That is extremely frustrating.  All I have to do is breathe and it does something totally unrelated to what I want to do. I'm still contemplating sending this cell phone back."
Hugo M.,1.0 out of 5 stars,the phone does not work and they took 100 dollars from me for returning it,Verified Purchase,"Â It does not work. It is a bad phone for the cost. the display fails and it is a general failure. also when returning it, amazon charges you 100 dollars to accept the return even though they sent a useless product"
Dobie Mom,2.0 out of 5 stars,Would not work with US Cellular,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get my Galaxy S20 FE phone as it was an upgrade from the S8 I've had for years.  I purchased the US version Unlocked and took it to my local US Cellular store to have a clerk switch everything from my S8 to the S20.  I was told by the clerk after she attempted to get the phone registered and set up with US Cellular that the phone was not compatible with the network.  According to the Amazon add this phone is supposed to be compatible with US Cellular so I do not know if I was getting a line of BS from the US Cellular clerk because I didn't purchase the phone through them (even though they no longer carry the S20 FE) or if it's false advertisement on Amazon (hence the 2 star rating).  I was so livid yesterday after leaving the US Cellular store that I just went home, started the return process to send this phone back to Amazon, boxed it up and dropped it off at the local UPS Store.  If I want to upgrade my phone I guess I'm stuck with purchasing a phone through US Cellular so I know it will work.  I'm looking at the Galaxy A52 as it's similar in price to the Cloud Navy S20FE that I purchased through Amazon.  I refuse to pay $1,000+ for an S series phone."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a machine!,Verified Purchase,"I like everything on it, excellent flagship smartphone."
Tiffany Yant,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not AT&T compatible.,Verified Purchase,I was not able to use my AT&T sim card for this phone. The technician said it's not compatible. It's only compatible with T Mobile and Verizon.
Mr.Kloud,1.0 out of 5 stars,Touchscreen messed up in dec 2020,Verified Purchase,"Like other reviewers have mentioned this thing has touch issues. I can be randomly scrolling on Reddit when the phone does something else randomly. I'm started the return on this , hopefully Samsung can fix the problem for  there. i bought this in nov, or dec 2020 and got my refund"
Patricia A Pittman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Updated Samsung Very User Friendly,Verified Purchase,"I am very happy with my new Samsung phone. It is a 5G with updated software that makes it user friendly. I am  very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others. I do not use a lot of data because I mostly us my phone for routine things like calls, texts, GPS, information on interesting topics.  I'm not a game player and this phone provides me with all the capabilities I need at a reasonable price."
Kal Far,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Wait a year, then buy one",Verified Purchase,"This unlocked phone has so many bugs! The touch screen is unresponsive 30% of the time. The phone will freeze for no apparent reason. The internet gets dropped no matter if you're on 5G, LTE, 4G, 3G or 2G.Besides all that, if you want a sleek and slim phone case with a kickstand, we'll tie gonna have to wait because they don't exist. Only the big, bulky brick in your pocket case with kickstands exists at the moment.Bottom line... This phone was put out on the market before everything was ready."
Annabelle,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Buy It!,Verified Purchase,"I've had this phone 11 days and it was supposed to be an upgrade for me from a cheaper brand of smartphones. The cheaper brand was good, but didn't last long. Now I miss those cheap ones.My new 20 FE 5G sometimes won't read my fingerprint. Annoying, but I just enter my pin.However, last night I tried and failed - over and over - to copy and paste something. It appeared to copy, but kept pasting the previous text I'd copied.I don't have a lot of money and this was a stretch for me. Now I'm stuck with a crappy phone.EDIT I've now had this phone 3-3Â½ months and, without exaggeration, I can say I hate it.An alarm began ringing today and it only stopped when I turned off the phone.Calls come in and I only know I've gotten them when I find a voicemail or look at Recent Calls.To paraphrase a friend - You know how 'phone' is spelled? It starts with an 'F.'"
Bob,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seamless with other Samsung products,Verified Purchase,"After owning this phone for 2 months I'm back being a Samsung fan. My last was the S4 and the 2014 note 10.4, I felt abandoned when Samsung didn't update. Just updated to Android 11 and I commend Samsung for keeping their word on supporting this phone.Battery life is good with heavy usage over 24 to 36 hour period. Usually have 15% when I plug in the charger. The finger print reader has a quick response if you find the EXACT spot on the screen. Screen is rich with color and response, but you'll need to adjust sensitivity if you use a screen protector. The phone has to many features to go over here, I will say that I'm only about 40% into discovery of moderate research of all the settings. If you have a smart things hub you'll love the user experience with the app. My Galaxy Buds+ and Active 2 watch also have a great interface and user experience."
Bobby,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone by Samasung,Verified Purchase,"Just recently purchase the Galaxy S20 FE 5G (1-2021) what a great phone, smart with many features and compact enough to keep in your pocket ( I had bought the Ultra model and it was to bulky to keep in your pocket) the battery life is great and it charges quickly with the charger that comes with the phone ( I read the S21 doesn't have a charger with the package) the camera is great, I'm a hobby photographer and use Olympus mirrorless camera and this phone comes very close to the same quality pics, another good feature is that is made in South Korea, some parts maybe made in China, but I want to stop buying Chinese products when I have a choice. The phone is beautiful well designed, is a small computer it connects to my PC and when I'm working I can receive and send messages from the PC., never mind the iPhone, this Samsung is great, if you have a choice buy it you will not regret it."
Marcelo Ordonez,3.0 out of 5 stars,Camera FOR SELFIES sucks.,Verified Purchase,"Â Everything on the phone is fine, love the cameras on the back, except the front facing camera FOR SELFIES ONLY. When I switch to the front facing video, it has a better quality, and it sincerely doesn't make sense, seems like a software issue, but still, paying a lot for this phone and getting mediocre results in selfie pictures is very disappointing, and illogical."
Andrew Werner,3.0 out of 5 stars,touch screen way too sensitive,Verified Purchase,"Should have believed the other reviewers who hated the overly sensitive touch screen.  Even with the ""block accidental touches"" option turned on, it is twitchy and very unpleasant.The phone does stream phone calls and music to my hearing aid via Bluetooth, which was what I bought it for, so I'm going to keep it - but I hate it and may store it in a foam-rubber-lined steel box to keep it from unlocking and starting some unwanted app.The typical Samsung bloatware is present and can't be deleted or disabled by someone as un-tech-savvy as me.  Same for the google pestware.  But I knew that from the git-go so can't complain.Still, listening to music is a blessing!  My hearing is such that even with a great stereo and speakers, it sounds like shit.  But played by the phone through Bluetooth to my hearing aid it sounds pretty good - and that's the best I'll ever get."
J.Colesberry,1.0 out of 5 stars,GARBAGE! DO NOT BUY!,Verified Purchase,"This phone is garbage I don't even use it. Battery life was extremely limited. I thought there was Spyware in the phone because the battery drained so fast. It was glitch, slow, frozen, functioned like it was infected with a virus (and it was not). I had to factory reset it literally once a month and ended up only adding essential contacts, it still wouldn't work smoothly. I ended up digging out my old Note9 and use it. Even with its cracked body and age, it works a million times better! Do not buy this phone, you will regret it"
L8rGatorTop Contributor: Pets,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected,Verified Purchase,"Edit: I'm a super heavy user.  I'm at about the 6 month, and now the device gets warm when it's taxed or the weather is a little warm.  And the battery life, whuch is still great, and dropped down significantly.  Love the phone.  Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in floridamark Edit:  one month in, and I love it!  Battery lasts all day, and I'm on my phone nonstop.I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them.  Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method, mostly.Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it's well protected.  Signal is great on tmobile.  5g is slower than 4g, so I turn it off.  but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors!  Updates get sent all the time.  So worth it!And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens.  For me it's a fun binoculars, but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance.  S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9.  The rest is pretty similar.---It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.I took very good care of my S9, but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to, but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh, and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.I love that it's the same width as my old phone, but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews, and how new this was. But this was cheaper, and so far I'm very happy with my choice.Please note, red it definitely an orangey red.  I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full.  The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly, and it wasn't even very slow.  The only things it didn't bring over were  paid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.I would say it's very slightly brighter than my S9. I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet, but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.Happy happy!"
M. Bishop,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great camera, everything else has issues",Verified Purchase,"This phone is disappointing.  The camera is the only good feature (which is truly awesome BTW).  The phone has many glitches.  It doesn't always stay connected to the WiFi in standby mode, it will just give me a blank screen sometimes and need to be restarted, and MMS sometimes won't go through without restarting the phone.  These are the issues I've had in the first month.  I've also even killed the battery a few days.  I had decided to return it, but just missed the cut off.  What a joke of a phone!This is my 5th or 6th Samsung Galaxy, and the 1st one that has not been worth it.  I will not be purchasing another Samsung phone."
S. Switzer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love this phone...,Verified Purchase,"I've always been a Samsung guy, but my last phone was a MOTO Z3 Play. It was nice, but weak camera and battery was getting bad at 30 months, phone also acting buggy even after factory reset... This S20 FE blows the MOTO away. It really is the perfect screen size! Not too big! WOW the 5G is incredible!!!!!!  Camera is great and I'm demanding... 120Hz is just the best, do not downplay this, it's smooth as butter.... love the screen print scanner, it's flawless no matter what people say, just keep re-entering same thumb as finger one, two and three, it reall is flawlewss if you do that... AMOLED screen is just BEAUTIFUL! Gorrilla Galss 3 is a must... battery life is great, I'm on it a lot and still 40-50% by end of day... supplied charger is plenty fast enough... menu is bloated and complicated, but manageable... LOVE the stereo speakers! Just an all around great experience... no need to get the S20. Great price here... sold by and shipped by Amazon, what more do you want??"
Dr. Ken,5.0 out of 5 stars,Decent phone for the money,Verified Purchase,"This SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G was not my first choice, but since LG has stopped manufacturing phones, it was my second choice.  Replacing my LG Style 6, which measures over 7"", this Samsung phone is smaller but still comfortable to use in most regards.  Most phones I and my wife have had these past several years have their fingerprint reader on the back of the phone, which is much easier to use and more comfortable.  The Samsung S20 FE has a fingerprint reader embedded on the bottom of the screen, which is a bit awkward to use.  But the fingerprint reader is fairly accurate providing you follow the directions and scan multiple areas of your fingertip.  The screen is vibrant with deep colors & good contrast.  Since my phone is primarly a phone that I occasionally use for texting, I haven't used the camera yet nor do I use all of the features associated with video.  I have my dozen or so apps that I use frequently, and they all work well on this phone.  There isn't much bloatware installed by Samsung; most of it is installed by Google.  I do seem to get a bit better connection with this phone.Setup was a breeze.  I use ConsumerCellular as my carrier, and all I had to do was move my SIM and microSD cards from the old phone to this new phone, and everything was automated after that!  I used the SmartSwitch app to transfer from the LG phone to the Samsung phone, and that went smoothly, easily and without issue."
Jason Baumgartner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product was received in excellent condition,Verified Purchase,"This phone arrived in pristine condition. Setup was extremely simple -- I simply removed the SIM card from the older broken phone and placed the card in the new phone. After about 10-15 minutes of configuration / downloading updates, I had a working phone that was much faster and more advanced than my older broken phone.The one downside is that I did a speed test on Verizon's 5G network and noticed speeds were no where near where they claimed 5G would be at this point. However, this is a carrier issue and not a phone issue so I didn't knock the review based on something outside the control of the seller.All in all, a great transaction and one that I wouldn't hesitate to do again in the future!- J"
Chanh Nguyen,4.0 out of 5 stars,very fast and no bugs,Verified Purchase,The phone S21 FE works perfectly with no bugs at all so far for 3 days.  Camera is good but not excellent in low light condition.  Battery drains fast with 120hz display.  The phone is very fast and all apps runs without any issue.  Phone call or internet connectivity works well.
Tony Y,5.0 out of 5 stars,S21 FE 5G,Verified Purchase,The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G it's a great device so far I got the 256GB model with 8GB of RAM and by comparing it to my current S20 FE side by side with the S21 FE the S21 FE is a little shorter and the S20 FE is a little taller but the one thing I don't like about the S21 FE is the back plastic when touching it with your finger it feel like one of those plastic tray that you get from the fast food restaurant and if you are planning to buy the S21 FE don't forget to purchase a skin wrap from sopiguard or dbrand and you might want to put a case on but I'm going to give the S21 FE 5 Star anyway it's a premium device with cheaper plastic back cover like a fast food to go plastic tray so far it's a really great phone
Lyn L,1.0 out of 5 stars,False Advertising!,Verified Purchase,"I bought this phone because it was ""unlocked"" and the Seller advertised that you can ""choose your carrier."" I spend 6 months in the U.S. then 6 months in Mexico and do not want a phone with 2 SIM cards. With an unlocked phone I should be able to switch out SIM cards depending on which country I'm in. I've done that before with a phone I bought in Australia. This phone accepted my Mexico SIM card and worked fine in that country. But I just returned to the U.S. and have taken the phone to 3 major carriers: Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T. Employees of each of those carriers told me that the phone is ""not compatible"" with their service and they could not get it to work! Of course when I contacted the Sellerhe/she said the warranty had expired and it was a Manufacturer's defect. I had no way of discovering the problem during the warranty period and the phone is not defective in any way! It's just not compatible with U.S. companies. Which means the Seller advertised it falsely in the first place!"
time. less.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Touch Screen Weird,Verified Purchase,"I've been using touchscreen phones about as long as anyone else. Many years. This screen is a little weird. Sometimes it won't track my finger completely, when I'm scrolling text. It's really disconcerting.The fingerprint reader doesn't work as well as older Samsung phones where it was on the back of the phone. Those worked almost always... maybe once every couple days it would need a second read.This one, probably 10-20 times per day it won't read my fingerprint right, and I have to do it a second, third, or fourth time. Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.Final problem: when I'm taking pictures with it, sometimes the camera app will ""freeze"" for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it's working, but just won't take a picture, no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen. Really annoying to lose 15 seconds of shots because the camera app sucks.One time it stayed ""frozen"" so long that the ""camera app has stopped responding"" thing popped up."
FB,1.0 out of 5 stars,Phone has issues - Please read,Verified Purchase,"I had this phone for 2 months! I cannot use the camera anymore and I get ""Warning: Camera Failed""! I tried every trick and reset and nothing worked! I had Sumsung Tech connect to my phone and they couldn't fix it. Simply put Samsung knows there is an issue and are reluctant to make it public. I am a very light user and very knowledgeable user and based on all sites I found where users are posting the exact similar issue, I wish I knew before buying this worthless phone but will never buy another Samsung product again. This was quickly baked and released to the market to make $$$$. No accountability Samsung! None! Please release a fix immediately or offer to exchange these clunkers that are less than 3 months old! Before you buy just google Warning Camera Failed....100's of new owners posted the issue. I also posted on Samsung's community web site. And, Samsung never called me back after not being able to fix it!"
disney lover,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great camera,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this phone a year ago. The camera on this phone is really great. Clear, sharp pictures. I do like the features of the phone. After having the phone for 6 months the middle of the phone became a dead spot. Every time I would tap on it nothing would happen. Now, the phone has been freezing up or closing the window I have open. There have been several updates lately. After the last two, my Galaxy watch will disconnect from my phone when I walk to another room. Very frustrating. I'm seriously considering getting a new phone. I love Galaxy phones. This is my third one. But, the issues with this phone are things that shouldn't be happening for another 2 years."
Tevii,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for money if you buy it on sale,Verified Purchase,"Bought the 256GB version when it was on sale for $599 on Amazon which was a very good buy.Overall it's a decent flagship phone, some may say lower tier flagship which I could understand. Performance is alright but it's Android so you will occasionally get app freezing every now and again. Camera is good (not great) but pixel 6 is better. I love the many many features that Samsung that this device comes with such as Bixby routines (game changer), Samsung Dex, secure folder, good lock, RAM Plus, a customizable always on display, edge panels, link to windows for synchronization with a windows computer, smart widgets (stacking multiple interactive widgets together that can rotate) video call effects with apps such as duo as duo, WhatsApp, MS Teams, zoom. The screen recorder actually captures the audio from a zoom or Google meet etc. Battery life is good enough once you don't use 120hz all the time (Bixby routine can help with that).This phone will get 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates so that's really great for longevity.Wouldn't recommend it for $699 but if you see it on sale for much less (you certainly will on Amazon) then go for it"
Randomness,1.0 out of 5 stars,This phone does not worth its price,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this for my parents to replace the old Galaxy S9+. Unfortunately I will have to return it because it seems to be either defective or too cheaply made with too many corners cut. First of all, the haptic feedback and vibration in general is very weak and doesn't feel as punchy as on S9+. Second of all, the display has worse color uniformity, you can notice the differently colored display areas at all angles. Last but most important - the automatic brightness is either buggy or completely broken, the phone decreases the brightness every time I lock it and when I unlock it - it does not increase the brightness to previous value (even in same room lighting) and keeps display very dim unless I am in a very bright room. This phone is not worth its current price for me with all the issues I have seen."
Dustin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Galaxy for the money.,Verified Purchase,"I chose this phone after using my GS8 beyond its service life. I only buy a new phone every few years when. I've owned several Galaxy phones in the past and have always been satisfied. This phone does it all. Good battery, good screen, good camera, fast charging, 4k video, good audio, good looks, multiple colors, SD card support, wireless charging, wireless power sharing, facial unlock, etc. I have never had any issues with this phone. This is by far my favorite phone ever. If I lost it today I would buy it again without hesitation. I did a lot of research before getting this, and when it was announced, I knew it would be the perfect phone for me. If you're considering this phone, please look up ""MKBHD S20FE"" on YouTube. He highlights a lot of things about this phone and they also gave it the phone of the year award. You cannot beat this value for what you're getting. I love it!"
Lights,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good,Verified Purchase,"Overall, I like the phone.  It's fast, stable, and feature packed.  I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me).  I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive, yet full featured phone.If I have one notable complaint, it's how the camera physically protrudes from the phone.  Not much, but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case).  This might be necessary for the camera's features and the ""thinness"" of the phone, but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass.  While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass, they don't stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.Overall very good, but I don't like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn't otherwise sit flat outside of a case."
mfander3,1.0 out of 5 stars,severe quality issue in the chip component level,Verified Purchase,"Just got my new 21S FE phone, last night.  just lightly use by playing around  YouTube for about less than an hour, then I noticed the back of the phone, close to camera area, was hot.  I just thought this is cheap phone, I read somewhere this phone has a hot issue while playing games (for more chip intensive usage). This morning I took the phone off wifi mode (since I am at home, phone automatically use my own WIFI for data), I want to check my att 5G speed again, but my S21 fe 5G is dead, thought phone clearly shows its under 5G coverage.  when I first got the phone last night I immediately check 5G coverage, It OK, work in my area.So, I have to suspect that last night's event of overheating that caused phones's 5G chip dead.Do I qualified to make this judgment without actual device testing?I , as retired Intel chip reliability engineer for 20 some years, audited plenty of semiconductor for quality issues. This type of event is called dead of arrival , a type of early infant mortality. I just wonder, Samsung should be able to screen out this type of ""walking dead"" failure in house, unless someone is cutting corner  here.I am not happy with ATT too - 16 years loyal customer, they just cut my Huawei Mat 20 Pro off, that's why I have to purchase a new phone, but I am very unsuccessful found equal quality with equal price range replacement phone.  Huawei Mat P20 pro which I used for 3 years, the price went up US$100 on Amazon.  yes, the only phone I noticed price went up after 3 years used. The quality of my Huawei mat P20 Pro just has incredible reliability.  There is reason Huawei is  hated by every phone manufacturer."
Chris S,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything you need with a little of what you want,Verified Purchase,"Upgraded from an S9+ and while I was admittedly missing my old phone at first, the S20 FE has quickly won me over. The fingerprint reader works great, the screen is nice. I love the 120hz refreshrate. The camera is excellent with more features and capabilities than I know what to do with. The phone is slim; I put a thin case and some cheap screen protectors on the front and camera and it still feels nice. It is wider than the S9+, so that took some getting used to. The phone is quick and responsive and I have never felt that I am wanting for processing power or RAM. If you use your phone for basic things, this will suit you just fine."
Old Time Engineer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed,Verified Purchase,"I've owned the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G for several months now and love it.  Initially, I didn't like that it didn't include Wifi calling but that was eventually added to my surprise during an update.  This was huge since my mom lives in bad cell phone coverage area.  The battery is excellent.  I haven't received any negative audio comments from anyone during voice call.  The camera is excellent.  Although it has 5G capability, I don't know when or if it is in use - It lacks an icon.  Oh, the top ""ribbon"" is a little tough to read.  Its a great phone and at a great price.  My wife likes it more than her iPhone."
Sattirdae,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fun Features. Great battery life.,Verified Purchase,"I have not had this phone for long; maybe a few months in with this device. The battery life is impeccable for me! I am a young person. That being said, I am on my phone very often. I have watched hours of movies, YouTube videos, and shows. I am not much of a tech nerd but I can say that compared to my old phone the battery lasts more than all day, after countless hours using it.I originally bought this type of phone because I hoped that it would not be obsolete in two years like my old LG K10. I also bought this phone for it's DeX feature. You can basically turn your phone into a computer desktop if you have a projector or desktop computer/laptop using an HDMI cord to type-C. This is an awesome device! The screen is very colorful and watching videos on it is perfect!I must say that this phones fingerprint reader is horrendous. It has only read my fingerprint about 62% of the time. I really do not care about it, because my old phone never even had that feature. I have not tried the face recognition feature yet.Something that I do not like is the back camera sticks out from the phone a little. I would recommend you get a phone case right away, or at least get camera and screen protectors ASAP. If you drop your phone one good time without a case and protectors, your whole phone would probably malfunction. The cameras I think would shatter internally."
CaliDreamer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone for a great price!,Verified Purchase,"Very happy with this item. This phone was reasonably priced and had all the features I was looking for. I put a glass screen protector on it as soon as I got it and a gel type case. I will say though, the glass screen protector does affect fingerprint recognition somewhat. Out of the box, the fingerprint sensor works great, but with the screen protector, it misreads the fingerprint maybe 1/5 of the time. But thatâs not a limitation on the phone, just the screen protector. Otherwise Iâm very happy. Display is beautiful and battery life is amazing!"
d hunter,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to love this phone, but...",Verified Purchase,"Update 5-7-22: UPS found the phone and delivered it to Amazon 5 days ago. And Amazon has still not scanned it to begin processing my refund. I'm beginning to think they have no intention of refunding me. Same story over and over with my questions going unanswered. They're reading off a script and could care less.Update 4-30-22: Be careful returning something of this price. UPS lost it!!!!! And now I have to fight Amazon for a refund!! I am beyond angry! UPS says it's up to Amazon to give me a refund, even though they lost it. Amazon says I have to wait until they get it back, or call back May 10th and beg them again for my money back!It's a major pain in the behind. Settings keep resetting on their own, pop ups happening with everything I do, it goes back to the previous app while I'm in the middle of something, and the camera focus is just awful. Battery life is ok, I guess. I'm not a heavy user and because of the way it's acting, I end up putting it down and walking away anyway. It's going to have to go back. Sorry, Samsung, but your older OS's where a lot better than this. Thank goodness I only needed this for a back up phone for the next time my iPhone screen goes black. I'll just get a cheap Moto. They work a lot better."
Ocean Gypsy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Intentionally Misrepresented Features,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this phone SPECIFICALLY for the DUAL SIM CARD functionality.  Its very hard to get a factory unlocked dual sim-card phone in the USA for warranty issues.  SAMSUNG announced in the press the S21FE5G would be the first, starting in January 2022.  As of May 2022, SAMSUNG has not unlocked this functionality.....and the website has removed references to the Dual Sim-Card.  Contacting Samsung support reveals they are still working on it, but OS update date is still unknown, and they will not estimate timing.As a stand-alone phones, is surprisingly poor.  I agree with most of the other technically oriented reviews.  Processor is clunky.  Screen isn't great.  Finger and facial recognition are unreliable. ANDROID OS not happy on this platform.I CAN NOT recommend this phone.  ANOTHER Samsung fail!"
Mo,1.0 out of 5 stars,What the hell,Verified Purchase,"Ok so I switched to this phone from a Google Pixel 3a. I set it up June 30th a day after I got it. The first problem was that my incoming messages from several people were time stamped as three hours before I received them when the reality was that we were having a real time conversation. This is still a problem but today I have encountered another  issue wherein the phone will not stop rebooting. It still does it in safe mode and the battery charger trick didn't do it either. Which means I will have to do another factory reset on this phone. The only reason this review has more than one star is because I used to be a Samsung stan before I got the pixel. If the factory reset doesn't work or if i can't do it before the phone reboots I am going to try and return it, this isn't ok.*Update: I did the factory reset and it didn't work. We are downto one star because this is not something I am ok with."
LMSchwartz01,5.0 out of 5 stars,A really nice phone but with Samsung software,Verified Purchase,"I love this phone. All of the reviewers' complaints about facial recognition and fingerprint access do not apply to me, because I do not use them. The transition from my old Motorola phone and my S21 FE I did myself with only a few problems. The screen is sharp, the size is comfortable and my applications run smoothly. The only app I have had trouble with is the Contacts app (Samsung), which will not let me edit Contacts. This problem is endemic in the S20s and S21s. I downloaded a Google app for contacts and had no more trouble."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Over heats,Verified Purchase,"I have not yet used the fingerprint or face recognition features. I fear that I may not have this phone for 2-3 years - my usual phone life. This phone is sometimes hot, even while sitting there unused, and sometimes it overheats while charging.  Other than that, I really like the phone, it is a little big (with a case, it does not fit the phone holder in my Toyota), but It is easy to use. I like that I can insert an SD card for storage - this is the reason that I purchased the S20 FE 5G, and not the S21."
Linda Graul,3.0 out of 5 stars,"GOOD, BUT WITH SOME ISSUES",Verified Purchase,"There was absolutely no written information in the case with this phone.  If I were a new cell phone customer I would have had no clue how to activate or use it.  I like the phone, especially the battery life.  I replaced my old phone because the battery didn't hold a charge.  In spite of getting technical support I have not been able to have the important dates in my contact list appear on my calendar.  I have had to enter them manually, which is a pain."
Ricardo Hidalgo,3.0 out of 5 stars,No SD memory slot and no headphones,Verified Purchase,"Being an industry standard, they should previously indicate that it does not come with a space to increase memory through SD memory (neither micro, nor mini, nothing). You also can't connect your headphones to the computer. Its graphics performance is excellent and its processor is very good, but the battery does not last as long as it was touted. It is important to know that if you are someone who takes a lot of pictures, or downloads your series or music to your phone, you must buy space in the cloud"
Nicholas,5.0 out of 5 stars,TL:DR Worth,Verified Purchase,"So let's start with the screen.  It's beautiful,  responsive, reads my fingerprints accurately. And it's got a lot of functionality with pip and other features.Next up is signal.  I live in a rural area so service is tricky,  but this beast finds signal in all but the most taxing of conditions,  inside a manufacturing plant for example.Camera is on the list too,  don't worry here we are. Overall it's a good camera.  It's not the best camera out the,  but it does a very fine job of trying to be the best. Many filters and functions await you here.The battery is impressive.  I'm kinda hard on my phone battery,  and this one could take the abuse. Fairly quick charging off a wall jack or portable battery with plenty of active use time.  You get more features here too with power sharing and highly tunable battery saving options.All in all,  I'm very satisfied with the phone and I'm sure many others feel the same.P.S.  That Snapdragon is a monster."
Don,1.0 out of 5 stars,simply bad phone,Verified Purchase,"struggled trying to take out the sim card holder. once i put in my verizon card, it did not work. then i had a heck of the time retrieving the sim card so that the phone can be returned. data transfer from note 8 was easy. other than that it is incompatible with verizon carrier. its more than disapointing considering my business is built on prompt response."
Sue Soergel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased with this phone,Verified Purchase,"I upgraded from an S10E and this is exactly what I was looking for.  I've only had it a few days so I'm still playing w/the options.  I haven't set up the Face recognition but the fingerprint reader works great.  I am very pleased with this purchase, the cost was cheaper and very pleased with the phone itself.  Thank you!"
Adam h,1.0 out of 5 stars,Screen broke in my pocket at movies 6 weeks after purchase,Verified Purchase,"I bought this phone because it seemed like a good alternative to the more expensive Samsung phones like the S21 or Note 20. I have had Samsung phones exclusively since about 2013 when I bought the Note 3 and thought for sure I would never buy from another manufacturer. At first I was pleased with the phone. Then about 6 weeks after purchase I got out of a movie to find my phone screen had cracked inside my pocket, nothing else was in there at the time. The screen is made of inferior materials to the ones in the flagship phones. I called Samsung customer support, after much back and forth managed to get a refund for the price I paid for the phone. I have a Pixel now and would never go back to Samsung. This phone is poorly designed and breaks easily."
robosolo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not-Ready-For-Primetime,Verified Purchase,"I really liked this phone at first. It was somewhat too large but had lots of very nice features. Then, after owning it 3-weeks, bad things started to happen. During calls the screen would keep going dark after 10-sec. I contacted Samsung and the tech could do nothing to fix this issue. He said they were working on it and needed to re-included an app that they removed but had no alternative. Then, the answer and hang-up buttons stopped working completely and the phone wouldn't shut off. Finally I had enough of this not-ready-for primetime piece of nonsense made by Samsung - a company that I had always respected. Fortunately I was able to return the phone through Amazon."
J. Barry Ryan,3.0 out of 5 stars,No Dual Sim,Verified Purchase,"This American version of this phone does not support a dual sim.  I am not sure why phone manufacturers think Americans do not want a dual sim capability, but I have two phone numbers and I want them in the same phone.  I sent it back.  Otherwise its a very nice phone."
Mrflashport,5.0 out of 5 stars,About the best unlocked Galaxy you can buy,Verified Purchase,"This is a gem of a phone. Perfect size, high end performance at a mid range price. Superb battery goes for DAYS with moderate usage. Can stream Netflix for 12+ hours on a charge and still have 20 percent left. Premium hardware, Samsung fully supports the US version so you get all the updates. I like the ""unlocked by Samsung"" setup, no crippling carrier trash or branding. Using mine on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile MVNO), get full 5G performance and seeing 500-600MB down inside my home.This isn't the cheapest phone but why play stupid games with carrier financing scams when you can ""buy once, cry once"" and get a great phone that you have the freedom to use with any carrier/MVNO and get the full Android experience on solid hardware that will last 2-3 years. I'm very happy with mine and I think you will be too."
UTAN,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome phone,Verified Purchase,"Coming from S9 i was hesitant to got with this phone, lower screen resolution but higher frame rate wasnt enough..I was also afraid the phone wouldnt be legit in Samsung Amazon store but wanted it asap, have prime so decided to buy it..Came aoon enough, I dont do pics so the phone camara is not a biggy for me.But i am blown away, the phone is quick, firgerprint reader work fast.. the position of it from the old S9 to S20fe is akward, i am used to the S9 firgerprint location but I am adapting.Has all i need , Samsung pay, Secure folder.. though now u cant set a specific fingerprint to Secure folder, maybe they will fix that in updates..Averall, impressed with it .. it is big.. and fast.. didnt needed to buy the flagship at all. This one has all I need."
janice399,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like  this phone Especially because Button Bixby is gone,Verified Purchase,"I am not having any problems with this 20 fe g5 phone.  It works good.  Put the att SIM in and was receiving texts and making calls without issue. I like the no wire charging, the easy backup of contacts and apps.  it was very nice to have the SIM card removal stick in the box.It was also easy to put the micro memory in on the other side of the service providers SIM,  SIM on one side flip little tray over and memory goes there, I watched a YouTube video on where memory went.  I know people need to lock their phones but I don't like to and I like that it allow that as an opt out.  Mostly  I hate Bixby and although Bixby still takes up space it isn't a button on the phone.  Bixby is the worst thing about Samsung phones"
zi,3.0 out of 5 stars,S21 fe 5g,Verified Purchase,"It's a right size, fast phone. Camera not too good but ok. Battery life is acceptable (about 6 hrs screen on ?) .  Sometimes hard to use fingerprints for waking up because screen no response and you need to use side button wake-up screen then fingerprint... other is when you using Google map make a phone call even you change to map it jump back to call  screen automatically.  I used this phone two weeks only. Probably will update the review later. Now only can gave it 3 "
Kristie Tropple,1.0 out of 5 stars,I will never purchase a Samsung again...,Verified Purchase,You would think for paying over 600.00 for a phone they could at least put a protective case on the damn thing.  I didn't even have it 1 day andropped it in the sand from only 2 feet up and the entire front of the phone shattered and busted the glass and the phone went dead.  WTF?
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Verified Purchase,I am so happy with my purchase I ordered my phone in my fiancee's phone on a Sunday and both products came Monday at a decent time before we ate dinner the phones were great battery life is great everything about this phone is awesome I love that I can get ex ternal storage in internal storage I love the fact that this phone were able to put SD card in otherwise I wouldn't get that Galaxy S21 but I am so satisfied with my purchase and everything about this phone works amazingly him I just couldn't be more happy
WingsOTWorld,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent enough phone but battery seems awfully weak,Verified Purchase,"I've had this phone for a few months now and I'm definitely happy with its overall performance and ability to power through what I ask it to. The camera is decent enough and it behaves like flagship without the price. It certainly outperforms my Samsung a71 which simply gave up on life after a year. That being said, the biggest issue I have with this phone is that battery just seems to lose percentage at an alarming rate for a new phone. I don't know if it's the battery chemistry or the systems taxing the phones systems but, the battery on this phone drains on par with my s10+ after I had it for a year. The thing I always demand out of my phones is a strong battery and this one is middling for something fresh out of the box.Oh and, the 5g hasn't blown me away either... I can't tell the difference between 4g and 5g, but that could be my provider and not the phone.In short, decent phone, good specs, battery makes this phone not perfect."
AC,1.0 out of 5 stars,Screen cracked without being used much,Verified Purchase,"Haven't even had the phone for a month yet. Love it. Unfortunately, without even doing anything to it the screen developed a hair line crack across it. Really annoyed and I've been a Samsung user forever. I haven't even dropped the phone yet and it's doing this. Very bad quality. Going to try to return it. I'm assuming this thing is defective. Will update once it is replaced with a different phone."
GRILLMASTER7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Flagship Features at a Great Price.,Verified Purchase,"After some research, I settled on this S20 FE 5g. It has flagship features for a reasonable price. Better than the S21 as I've learned. After using an iphone 5s for many years, wanted a 5G phone with wiresless charging, expandable memory, fast processor, more ram and at least a 4500 mah battery to last a few days. Also got a notice that At&t was ending their 3G network in February so it was time. The mint green was out of stock from Amazon but luckily I found one from this seller in used but brand new condition with at 90 day seller and Amazon warranty. Expected it to take a few weeks to get here but got it 2 days later. It came in the original packaging with all the accessories. Plastic wrap still on the back and sides of phone. Works great so far. Would buy from this seller again. Checked with Samsung Support and was informed that there was still a manufacturer warrany on it. So far so good. Just relieved to have a phone that works fast and last all day."
Burger ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gorgeous, durable phone",Verified Purchase,"This phone is absolutely gorgeous in color, sleek, and has such amazing battery life. I do have to say, I chose the 20 FE specifically for the color and because it has better camera specs than the other phones in the 20 line. I love how fast it is, how well it connects to Bluetooth, the color on the screen, the camera features (both front and rear) and so much more. It is pretty durable too. I've dropped it without a single scratch or crack. The thing that I probably miss the most about my S9 is the curved edge as this phone is flat but it's obviously not a deal-breaker for me. I do also have pretty small hands so one-handed use is a little bit difficult even with a ring on the back of my case. Overall, I am very happy with this phone!"
Lorrie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to return, is not compatible with AT&T",Verified Purchase,"The day we rec'd this phone we took it to an AT&T store for the SIM card.  The card would not fit.  My daughter was so upset and this was her birthday gift so it upset me too.  While all the features of this phone is what brought us to this phone I will say that all of her information transferred smoothly with the Samsung app, but without the SIM card working, we had no service.  Phone had to be returned."
Lindsay Lacy,5.0 out of 5 stars,The camera is quite impressive,Verified Purchase,This phone is everything you could ask for in a phone. The camera on this phone out performs the IPhone 12. All my friends with an IPhone were jealous of the camera. The camera is my favorite thing. 30Ã zoom is amazing. I could take pictures of animals from a good distance away without scaring them off. Incredible. I have had no trouble at all with this phone. There is zero lag. 120 hertz display is gorgeous. You will love this phone. It's a steal for 600 bucks
miacca,4.0 out of 5 stars,Took FOREVER to come !!!!,Verified Purchase,It took forever to come. I literally got it almost a week after the order date. Amazon told me to file a police report. I was sooo scared it had been stolen but since having it for about a day... it's so far so good. I like it a lot. Fingerprint works well haven't taken many pictures  yet but the quality and zoom functions  are pretty amazing. I hope it lives up to my expectations. Battery life doesn't last very long but it's not a MAJOR issue. Just holds a slightly less charge.
NENA,2.0 out of 5 stars,"phone is good, packaging was not.",Verified Purchase,"the box the phone came in was very dirty, and when I opened the box the phone was very dusty. cleaned everything with lysol wipes. Other then that the phone itself is great! The screen, camera, and battery life are really good. works with my samsung watch 3. Since it is a Samsung phone I figured it would work with my Samsung gear 360 camera, my samsung s9 works perfectly with it. Unfortunately the 360 camera app is not compatible with this phone and will not connect to the camera. Just wanted to give a heads up for anyone that has this camera, I did not see anyone mention this issue."
Anonymous1,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good battery life but phone has issues,Verified Purchase,"I really like the amount of storage this phone has, but 4 months in and it's been having issues with replaying the motion capture video for pictures. Using double-tap to light up the screen when it's off works probably 70% of the time. Swipe is terrible. I have a tempered glass screen protector on it but I have never had a phone be so bad at swipe with one on. I will try to swipe a word and end up with something completely random or it doesn't recognize the word I obviously swiped (e.g. ""adhesive"" instead of ""aggressive""). My Samsung S7 was better at recognizing than this one. Another issue with swipe is that it'll stop tracking and give you a bunch of jumbled things all broken up like ""ch a game"".I've also had issues with certain apps, only with this phone. I am only 4 months into having this phone and I'm starting to regret my purchase. Unless it starts improving, I'm not sure I feel great about having this -- nor expecting it to last -- the next few years or so."
Nichole,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy!!!!!,Verified Purchase,My phone all of a sudden stopped recognizing the sim that was in my phone after working perfectly fine for 8 months.  You can't get it warrantied through Samsung unless the proof of purchase has the IMEI number on it.  I had to send my phone in twice to try and get repaired.  Dealing with Samsung supports has been awful.  I also purchased the 2 year protection plan that's a joke because they wont help till the manufacture warranty is expired. what a night mare.  HEY SELLER get the the IMEI numbers on the invoice/receipt so we can get the device fixed if it breaks for no reason.
Mark,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Love my new phone,Verified Purchase,"I am coming from a Samsung 7 and loved it.  The battery was going and was debating of putting in another.  I decided to go with the 5G option.  It's the future.  Screen is beautiful, vibe, camera is better than the 7 which I thought was good.  Would buy again, and it was a great price when I purchased it."
chip,2.0 out of 5 stars,Reception,Verified Purchase,"I am unable to get 5g forever so what's point getting a 5g phone!, as I found out nothing. could not even pick up 4g service with It, so mad after wasting time in Verizon store packed all the time and useless tech support, returned it.  I will say it has the best camera in a phone ever seen"
Kaleigh ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Mid-range Phone!,Verified Purchase,"I honestly haven't had any problems with this phone and I've had it for over a month now. Honestly I think it's a perfect mid-range phone since I wasn't willing to pay flagship prices for the higher end s20's. This phone is fast and the 120hz makes scrolling flawless. The camera, while not the best on the market, still takes amazing pictures unless you zoom in too much. The battery life lasts way longer than my old phone, I usually don't have to charge until I go to bed. Of course if you're using it all day then the battery will drain quicker, otherwise yes it does last all day. Also I have MetroPCS and had no problems switching to this phone or connecting to the 5G network. Overall, if you looking for a decent but cheaper upgrade then this is the prefect phone!"
nony,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hidden MicroSD slot...,Verified Purchase,I had earlier given this phone a 1 star when I thought it had no SD slot... but with the help of a friend... I located the slot behind the sim slot...this would have been explicitly stated in a diagram... but that I did not see ... am updating my review to 4 Star will increase or decrease my rating based on how the phone performs.
Curlee Locs,2.0 out of 5 stars,Make Sure--The Screen Lock Is Not Locked....,Verified Purchase,"When I did receive my Android phone, the 5G Tower being in repair for weeks on, and the screen lock being on without a passcode (to know and available) to unlock the phone.  Also, I did need the phone for emergency reasons.  The phone takes time to learn the general operating of the phone because the phone is not as intuitive as other Smartphones that I have purchase in the past.  Because of all these complications, my initial experience with the Samsung Galaxy S21 Fe 5G being not so good.  The 5G Tower--this is not the the fault of the makers of this phone.  The passcode place on the phone's screen; I do not know whose fault that being.Now, the focus being on the phone only...not what some outside influences did do wrong.  It is a good phone that has almost boundless options for data protection and security options.  It is a sleek looking phone with good and comfortable (handheld) scale and dimensions."
Ise Loa,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent..!!!,Verified Purchase,"Other than not having a headphone jack (WHY..???) - I'm very happy with this phone. All files including text messages, photos, documents, music - pretty much everything - transferred easily from my old phone to this one. Operating system is pretty much the same - also very nice. Not a fan of Bixby - it was easy to shut off. Stays charged for days. Happy with this purchase, for sure..!!!"
Firregani,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as intended,Verified Purchase,"The phone is unlocked but some services will have problems adding it and will insist it's already been attached to a carrier.  Fingerprint reader isn't great with glass screen protector and for some reason all glass screen protectors come with a hole for the front facing camera so fuzz builds up making the image quality poor.I have no qualms with the phone itself though. Works great, it's fast. Restarts amazingly fast. Great photo quality even with the fe version."
Heather D Burgess,5.0 out of 5 stars,Even better in person!!!,Verified Purchase,"Purchased the Samsung Galaxy s20 FE 5G  as an upgrade from a galaxy s9+. So far, this phone is awesome. Samsung makes the back out of metal instead of glass now, so that's a plus. The color red you see in the images is not the muted red you get in person. It actually looks kind of a metallic and immensely better!!!! There is not a tool in the box to open the sd drawer, it was fortunate we had one from a previous phone so we could activate it and insert the memory card. The charging cable is short, a longer one would be nice. I also like how Samsung did away with the curved edges on the screen."
Gowe,1.0 out of 5 stars,I don't know,Verified Purchase,I return the phone because my cell phone company told me they were not gonna support my phone with 3G however my phone Samsung is able to use 4G and I have to switch providers but is but I also didn't have to buy a new $700 phone so I returned the phone and didn't even take this one out of the BoxI return the phone because my cell phone company told me they were not gonna support my phone with 3G however my phone Samsung is able to use 4G and I have to switch providers but is but I also didn't have to buy a new $700 phone so I returned the phone and didn't even take this one out of the Box
Nicholas E.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrific upgrade.,Verified Purchase,"Upgrading from a Galaxy S6 makes this a very drastic upgrade. Adaptive display makes things scroll smooth, faster hardware makes for a snappy performance, upgraded OS is sweet, fast (enough) face recognition and fingerprint scanner and the camera... Oh the camera. Can't get enough of it.The one thing I'd have to say makes me take of half a star is the battery life. A full charge lasts me literally 24hrs. Not sure if it was supposed to, but I was expecting something longer.Other than that.... This phone is excellent!"
Joe,3.0 out of 5 stars,Found Galaxy s20 FE to be VERY glichy,Verified Purchase,"Got this for my birthday and was frustrated with it out of the box. I have an older Galaxy and fond it meet all my needs. The new  Galaxy s20 FE is setup with the side power button automatically opening Bixby. . . total BS. Easy fix once you dig into the setting. The much bigger issue is Bluetooth, or I should say almost Bluetooth. It inconsistently recognizes devices. After multiple attempts finally got earbuds working.Hopefully I can get all the little annoying glitches figured out and make this a phone I won't regret getting."
P. Hernandez,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I thought,Verified Purchase,"Ok so I bought a new phone since TMobile kept blaming my Google Pixel 3A on my bad service ( dropped calls, no connection, no internet) and I am still having the same problems. Also I hate the biometric reader on the front! Backside is much more natural and convenient.  Pictures are nice battery is about the same. So really mad I could have waited a while longer to shell out for a new phone and accessories."
Coffee Owl,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good space, meh battery",Verified Purchase,"Got to be honest I am not using the finger print feature since my hands are messed up, and didn't do the face recognition since I always wear a mask, but the phone is fine. It has a lot more storage than my other phone and the layout is perfect for me. Pictures and videos come out great as well. However, the battery on this is not great. Do not expect this phone to last for over a day evsn if you're just watching YouTube on it. If you need a phone to hold a charge for a long time I might not get this unless you got things to charge your phone with on stand by."
Deborah L. Fiddler,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't hold signal for conversations,Verified Purchase,This is the worse phone I have ever owned.  many great features. The one thing you rely want it for is for communication. This phone will not let me have conversations for over 5 minutes on some occasions I've gotten 10 minutes.  When it started cutting me off is was not often but now I can not keep any conversation without being cut off. Frankly  face recognition or fingerprint mean nothing if you can't use the phone for its primary purpose. For $600 I'm extremely  disappointed.
4u1solo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An OtterDefender case, don't buy the phone w/o the case!",Verified Purchase,"These slippery glass, expensive toys are too hard to handle - securely.  Aside from the hundred of dollars, they are a pain to move from a broken one to a new one, a pain to reconfigure too.  The Samsung S20 series are best of breed, whatever you will use it for, it is versatile, flexible, and there is an 'ap' for it that will do whatever you want any cell to do!  It is sized to fit my hand, I think that it will fit your hand too.  You'll need a teenager to get it going, configured for you and the flexibility is totally awesome.  there are erbatteries in other phones, but this will cover you from sunrise to sunset."
Mark,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fast performance Smartphone with plenty of internal storage and expandable with MicroSD card,Verified Purchase,"I give the phone four and half stars for fast speedy performance, great cameras, fast battery charging, great price, and excellent expandable MicroSD card storage capacity up to 1TB. The only thing I like to see improved is the amount of RAM. The smartphone comes with 6GB of RAM. I already have 3GB of RAM used. Like to see at least 8GM of RAM. I also like the fact the phone is unlocked. You can take the smartphone to the carrier of your choice."
Jay Coventry,5.0 out of 5 stars,Virtually perfect,Verified Purchase,"Keyboard disappears here and there and you have to relaunch it somehow.I guess it's a matter of getting used the phone is all.  Updated to Android 12 on 2/5/2022The battery life is just average, but that depends on how you use your phone, how much you doing the internet, downloading, etc.Otherwise, it's a really nice phone and I'm really happy with it!"
Cora in LA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice phone, large learning curve",Verified Purchase,"Phone shipped quickly and is definitely factory new.  Still learning how to operate, fingerprint security feature is too slow to set up, it can't read my fingerprint for some reason.  Camera is good, sound quality is pretty good here in the hills.  Good phone overall, 5G makes a difference.  Battery lasts longer once many unnecessary apps are disabled. Thanks!"
lisseth,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pandora, Group Messages, & Incoming messaging pictures",Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to finally get a decent phone and I was looking into this one because I really care about the camera quality. According to my husband this was good phone. I went ahead and bought it. It's been a while since I've paid a lot for a cell phone because all I needed it for mainly was for calling/ texting/ pictures. Since my old phone doesn't take good pictures I asked my husband for a camera or a better cell phone that took good pictures. Everything went fine until I wasn't able to download or accept group messages or pictures. Also, I usually listen to music on my way home from work and Pandora didn't work at all. It kept skipping the music and at times it would work, but other times it wouldn't. I spoke to a Amazon Tech, I went online on google to look for ways to try and fix these issues. I restarted the phone, clear the data, the cache. I tried everything I could and it wasn't working. I returned it because I want a phone that actually works. It might just be a defective phone, but not satisfied especially since I had bought all the protection for this phone ahead of time."
Lance Larkin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Huge downgrade from note 9,Verified Purchase,"Using a note 9, then got this s20FE for a work phone. So many features missing, can't deep press screen to wake up phone, there is no fingerprint scanner, face recognition doesn't work well. The camera is too low so when you install a screen protector its within a small circle that fills with dust very easily. The rear camera lense stick way out of the phone requiring you to buy a separate protector for the back. When a slim phone case is on its nearly flush with the rear lense/glass.There are a lot less options for cases, went with same brand of case and they didn't even give it a back stand either.This phone is one worth skipping over, definitely not worth more than $250..."
PDS,3.0 out of 5 stars,"May be a nice phone, idk",Verified Purchase,"I ordered the phone and it didn't come with a charger cord, just the phone.  I haven't charged or used it, yet.  I recently decided to use the charger I already had, but it doesn't charge as fast.  The phone  freezes during app downloads, at times.  I have to push button on the side of the phone for it to light up, before using it.  The battery life is just ok.  Overall, I like the phone and maybe this one just has glitches, idk.  Probably exchange or return it.  I welcome any suggestions of a nice operating/functioning affordable phone."
isis,5.0 out of 5 stars,If it works in Honduras 100%,Verified Purchase,"I come from a samsung j7 (2016) and having this cell phone is so beautiful, it is a big change I like it so much, I love it comes unlocked from the factory, I am from Honduras I have Red Tigo and it worked 100% since the first time I put the chip, I do not touch walking activating the cell phone and spending more, facial recognition I have not tried it, the reader footprint I feel that it costs you always have to put my little finger at least twice because it does not recognize it, I think it is downloaded a little fast, this in 100% I start to play a little while and I already have it in 97 and a game that is not bad (Beach buggy), sometimes I feel it is hot by the top next to the camera because I think it is because I pass stuck on the cel all day and the ambient temperature here does not help, when I put it to charge fast charge in about 1 hour and 10 or 30 mints., the rear camera is sensational I love its night mode is very sharp, the front camera is not very happy if you are not in good light condition the photo will look rare, the video in 4k is amazing, has good functions cell phone, I really recommend a lot color is beautiful. Only the cell phone, the charger and some papers came in his box. If you are interested in this cell phone buy it, it is a good choice, you will not regret it."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,I am not a techy person but this phone seems to be easy to work with so far.,Verified Purchase,Biggest thing is that is you have to buy separate ear phones for this phone as the ones I had before do not work with this phone.  I love the fingerprint reader.  Battery life is good. I do not use the facial recognition so really do not have much to say about it. I've heard complaints about the size of the phone.  I have no complaints.  I absolutely love the amount of storage this phone has 128 G.  This is one of the reasons I chose this phone.
Anubhav Jain,2.0 out of 5 stars,Almost a flagship killer! But this model do have a touch screen issue,Verified Purchase,"I got this phone today and as soon as I got the phone, I install the Touch Screen test application from play store to check the touch screen issue. I can clearly notice that this model of samsung have ghost touch issue. I really liked the phone and it could be a flagship killer phone. But, due to this issue I have to return this phone."
Dareshiranu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great speakers.,Verified Purchase,"My previous phone - LG G8 Thinq - was flaking out on me, the battery not holding anything like a proper charge. I looked at several models/brands in a modest price range (that were also available) and since this was actually available and also since the faster CPUs seem to universally overheat (and I don't tend to play games) this seemed like a good phone to try. The cameras review well and I was able to get a belt clip for it too.The best part by far though are the speakers, far louder and clearer than my previous phone or in fact any previous phone I've owned. I like to listen to YouTube while I walk my dog, don't really want headphones and this is a fantastic improvement."
Cody Humphrey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Big Upgrade,Verified Purchase,"This phone has been a solid upgrade for me, minus an issue with my service provider. After 4.5 hours in several stores, I was unable to get this unlocked phone to connect to the Sprint Network, and had to get my account transferred to T Mobile. Butt they're the same company now, aren't they? My wasted weekend says no. If you're a Sprint user, you can get it to work on T Mobile, eventually, so expect some frustration.That said, battery life is awesome so far. I did change the refresh to 60 HZ from 120 HZ to help it last longer. Fingerprint reader has been flawless for me. Camera is awesome. Android transfer program moved most of my stuff over, although I did have to manually reload about half of my apps. In general, I love this phone."
Kole,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was a little wary of buying a phone on Amazon but it's worth it,Verified Purchase,"Buying a new phone online was a little sketchy but with Amazon's easy return policy I went for it, bought my unlocked s21 fe it showed up in 1 day, I put my Sim card in downloaded an app to switch all my stuff over and done brand new phone hooked up to Verizon without ever going to the store will buy my next phone from Amazon as well"
Eric Williams,1.0 out of 5 stars,no charger - type C dbl end cord...wtf?,Verified Purchase,An obvious money grab.  I won't comment on the phone as it has to be charged and without a charger or usb compatable cord that can't happen until I get one.  <explitives deleted>
Dan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really Regret this Purchase,Verified Purchase,"This is a bad phone.screen response time, launcher and functionality is very irritating.Some people want a sleek, responsive and UI that is intuitive. This phone has none of these essential qualities.When I refresh this phone again, I will never look at Samsung.please look elsewhere and save yourself buyer's remorse."
Kaoko,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overall it's just okay. Very annoying fingerprint sensor.,Verified Purchase,The phone has a lot going for it. It's fast and has good reception with tmobile. Unfortunately it has some quirks that really hold it back. The fingerprint sensor is absolutely terrible. It fails about half of the time. No matter how good the phone is you will hate it if it rejects you every other time you try to use it. Also if you are looking at the screen in sunlight it will get very dim after a few minutes to the point that it is not usable. I think this is to prevent overheating but I have never seen any other phone do that. Overall this phone is okay but I don't love it.
james madison,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best phone for the buck,Verified Purchase,Perhaps one of the best phones on the market at a decent price.Camera is spot on great face unlock and a great display i have owned a galaxy s10 plus and never utilized the quad HDThis phones battery will last much longer than  an s20 because its bigger and its resolution is not hitting that 1440P.s its 120hz is addictive
Me,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dont bother,  it's turd...",Verified Purchase,"Total piece of crap waste of money. Half the time I can't hear people on the phone. It freezes, touch screen doesn't work properly. It's as if this phone was released way too soon before it was ready. It was a pretty inexpensive galaxy tho so I thought why not. Now, I know why not. BTW the camera on S8 has better looking photos.My husband is watching my struggles with this phone and he's using it as an opportunity to say ""see, I told you you should've gone with an iphone"". As an android loyalist, this is extremely disappointing and infuriating."
Alexis Mcphee,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice upgrade from anything below the s10,Verified Purchase,ProsFast ChargingWireless ChargingNice zoom and camera colors for that back cameraLots of Ram for GamesSamsung DEXConsreally REALLY poor front facing cameraOnly allows i think 4 finger prints that often failThe charger it comes with doesn't seem to be Using the full charging potential
digitalk,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! At $499 it's worth it even in 2022.,Verified Purchase,"I love everything about this phone (128 gb, 6gb ram, Snapdragon chip version)  It's looks, specs, camera, call quality, performance, all the usual stuff. At $499 it's a bargain at the price point simply because of the Oct 2020 release date.One issue for me is I use it for personal and work. I think this causes a Play Store App install issue (not sure if it's Android or Samsung bug). At first it seems unfixable. But in my case removing the Sim card and SD card ND then a reboot fixed it."
angela l bolin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Capable phone.,Verified Purchase,"The S21FE delivers the speed I need and reliability I love. The only problem I ran into was the texting app. It was not working with most texting applications. I did not want to hard restart the phone and do a factory reset. I had just set up everything. I searched and found textra working beautifully, so I will just paid for that texting appâno other issues. I'm happy with the phone."
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst phone ever,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get this phone on Amazon prime day and it has turned out to be the worst phone ever!!  I loved the fact the volume is so loud, however it cuts out daily on speaker and just cuts out in general.  I am so sorry I bought this phone and unfortunately couldn't return it within the return window because I was sick with Covid and covid pneumonia.  Don't waste your money!"
LUIS KEMPER PERERA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Been using Samsung for long,Verified Purchase,Really everytime they get better with long lasting batteries (can last up to 2 days if not checking and using all the time) and also everytime better camera
Customer Upgrayedd,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure...,Verified Purchase,"Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews, when there should be 4's. Why? In June 2021, the sellers posted 8 GB of Ram and the phone only had 6 GB. That's false advertisement. Apparently they change their description off and on.I lose power quicker than I imagined I would.  My friend has a Samsung 9 and his power last longer than mine, go figure.It's not a bad phone. Yet, sometimes I do wonder if it was refurbished and not new. Some little odd things here and there."
Alan,1.0 out of 5 stars,2nd Sim Card Slot Does not Work!,Verified Purchase,"Same as the other reviews, 2nd sim card does not work at all. This is a completely stupid setting!"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great hardware, annoying to use.",Verified Purchase,"Bought this phone because my pixel 3 microphone died after two years and I wanted higher quality hardware. This phone has that. Camera is very good (though colors are sometimes a little off compared to Pixel). Microphone is clear, speaker volume is much louder, things load fast, it's waterproof,, etc etc. But the Samsung version of Android is extremely annoying to use. My typing is slower than ever, I often must repeat touch inputs multiple times. Fingerprint reader works fine though your fingertip must be at just the right angle, flat to the screen. Auto brightness adjust is awful and when unlocking the phone in a dark room it will flash super bright in your face before correcting. Phone is just large enough that one-handing is difficult, which causes me to tap things I didn't want to and drop it more. Overall, it works fine, or even very well, but it's simply unpleasant to use. I guess they've got to find some way to remind you that you didn't spring for the ultra expensive flagship phone."
Jovana Casillas,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,Verified Purchase,I bought this phone because I needed to. My old phone had a cracked screen and it had started to glitch. So I choose this one.This phone is exactly as described. Battery is ok; won't last more than a day. I don't use my phone for many things so it's a good option for my everyday life.
bunnygirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,The price was right,Verified Purchase,"Big learning curve from a S6 to this one.  Took 3 days just to get use to it and still can't get the buttons right to turn it off.  Great color! both inside and out.  Most of the features and apps I will probably never use and added a few I do use.  Vendor was quick to get it here no problems,."
Chris K,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best. Upgrade. Ever.,Verified Purchase,"I'm writing this review on this phone. I bought this after my S9 began to really slow down and stop working. This phone is, hands down, amazing for the price. I've only used my portable charger once since buying this phone and that was when I first got it and the phone was at around 50%. I was so used to my old phone dying I didn't realize the battery life on this one was great. I can leave my house at 9am at 80%, use Bluetooth and play around on it almost all day, use snapchat and text and watch videos on it, and come home by 9pm to 20% and it can still go for another hour.I've used this phone up to 5% with no real issues and for someone who's out the house for hours at a time, this is great news.The fingerprint reader is, in my opinion, better than the S9 and in a better place. The facial recognition is also great. And the ability to transfer all my data AND keep my pages in the exact same layout was, no doubt, AMAZING!The only MINOR complaint I have is the lack of a microsd slot. I personally don't need it much but some might and I could see how that'll be an issue."
Larry V.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Upgrade from Samsung J7,Verified Purchase,"I upgraded from a Samsung J7 using Net 10.Getting Net 10 phone number switched to this phone was not easy as I installed the ATT Sims. Net 10 switched the number OK but I couldn't call in or out. Finally I used the Verizon Sims and all is OK.Note that Amazon has a Net 10 Kit for $1 with 3 sims, ATT, T-Mobile and Verizon. So try to find out which service your old phone uses. I gave them , the old phone sims # and they said to use AT&T but it was Verizon.I love the S21 Fe's display, speed, everything works good but BIXBY is a PITA as I couldn't turned the phone off and the chat line was waiting for me to changes the sims.  I found how to disable Bixby and all is OK.It is very light and apps install easy. All is well using Net10.SmartSwitch App was very helpful in moving contact, etc from my old J7."
Booskerdu,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't recommend,Verified Purchase,"Worked amazing the first 2 days, after that the battery life has gotten worse and worse. After a year, battery life is ridiculous. Have to charge it 2, 3 times a day.The storage space is fantastic.By ""lavender"" they actually mean pink."
Home Owner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone,Verified Purchase,"Just received these phones, we upgraded our house to three Galaxy S20's on Prime-Day Sale, we can't complain thus far. Very responsive and manageable with one hand. Easy to transfer over all files, easy to get the phone activated and running.... pull the sim form the old phone and pop it into the new GS20, start it up and on the 5G Hwy...I recommend so far *thumbs up*"
DP,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed/Refurbished,Verified Purchase,"I'm so disappointed I got a buggy phone, its like I got a refurbished one. Google closes on its own, and some apps do not work right, which works fine on my 5 year old phone."
BluntedNina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!,Verified Purchase,"Brand new phone. Seems to be fully unlocked as I'm using in Dominican Republic and all company's sim cards works perfectly.I haven't encountered any issues with it. Battery life could be better but maybe is because I'm too happy to stop playing with it lol.Camera could be better, specially the ""30x zoom"" which is bs, but I didn't really buy it for the camera so I don't care."
Ashley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,The battery life is great and lasts longer than any other phone I've had. When using it I immediately noticed how fast and smooth it was from switching between apps and playing games and scrolling on Insta. I absolutely love it. I'm glad Samsung ditched the glass backs and went back to something more solid. It has a good size screen and nice weight to it. I added a Spigen case and screen protector.
Simon Garcia,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than samsungs own midrange phones,Verified Purchase,"Phone came wrapped in the proper packing material and a samsung super fast charger, phone was as expected with a few barely noticeable scratches. Other than the screen scratches the phone is pretty much out of the retail box. Definitely legitimate samsung product for a lot less. The phone itself runs very smooth and was indeed factory unlocked, the in screen optical fingerprint reader is pretty fast and accurate, the face recognition uses the phones 32mp front camera and could use some work, but is still fairly reliable. Great and fast phone even in 2021, if you can get a good deal on a S20 FE 5G, it's definitely worth it"
Kankakee Local,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of junky,Verified Purchase,Going from an s10 to this was a downgrade. This phone is pretty leggy with load times and doesn't have expandable memory. It feels cheap and the cameras are sub par next to the older galaxy. I expected a decent phone out of the s21 fe and got a cheap budget phone that is rather slow. Wish I got a normal s21 :(
K L. Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars,No wall plug-in adapter,Verified Purchase,Very upsetting  to me when I purchase a cellphone and there isn't a wall plug in adapter included !!!
Shotsie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone except for one drawback,Verified Purchase,"I bought the larger memory version of this phone (256 gb), plus the ability to store videos on the removable memory chip.  I volunteer for a concert organization and often record shows.  So far, so good.This phone doesn't support the Verizon UW 5G - but it does support the lower band 5G.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the services that use Verizon cell service do not support this phone - I'm stuck with Verizon (luckily , Verizon knocked off $10 per line for autopay).  It's kinda strange, since at least one of the services support this phone.Otherwise, the phone price and features are sweet for an unlocked device."
Joey B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good budget phone...,Verified Purchase,"Good budget phone. It has all the up to date specs as most other phones do. The face and finger print reader work well. It works with most 5G networks. No lag or battery drainage for a new phone. Camera has a lot of options. Only complaint is, after a I bought the phone the price went down almost $50 30 days later. Of course, after the return date. I really hate when Amazon does that. Other then that, it works great."

VINE VOICE
",VINE VOICE,Blazing Fast,Verified Purchase,"The difference between my old reliable 4G phone and this one could be measured in light-years.  This phone is phenomenally fast and easy to set up.  The fan apparently did an excellent job in determining the factors to be included in the Fan Edition.  It is so fast I had a near a quicker touch on the screen with my finger or I found myself lost.  Super responsive, and clear and crisp display of vivid colors.  I am enamored and likely to get in trouble as I can't stop fiddling with my phone to do my work."
Sae,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,"I've had this phone for 3 days. The only problem I cam across was when someone called while hooked up to my earbuds the call was not showing on my phone at all. I would hit the phone button and it would take me to recent calls or the keypad, I also tried pulling the top menu down to see if it would show as a notification but nothing. Kind of weird. Other than that, the phone was packaged great.I used it on Cricket first then put the sim in for Metro. Truly unlocked no problems at all! Packaged great. I will update if anything changes"
James Bass,3.0 out of 5 stars,A pain in the butt to shut down or restart,Verified Purchase,"I have used a Samsung S6 Active for years but I finally purchased a new phone. I really miss the ease of shutting down or restarting the phone. You should never have to watch a video to find out how to do this simple task but it is a requirement here. Even then I forget and have to go out and search the net on how to do it again, again... Otherwise, it is a OK phone."
Leo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice phone,Verified Purchase,"What I like about this phone:It's faster and newer than my old Samsung J7, to be fair any 2020 phone is probably better than an old J7.Love the wireless charging. I like the bigger screen and image quality is super nice, even compare to other 2020 phones. Sound is clear, even at maximum volume.What I wish it had:Expandable memory slotI know other versions have it, this one doesn't. Storage is 128gb, which is plenty since I usually don't keep important files in my phone. Encrypted files in the cloud As far as 5G is concerned, it works well but there at times is really slow, so it's off for now.In summary, I am very happy with this phone."
pool boy,3.0 out of 5 stars,5g not working,Verified Purchase,Purchased last year.  At first this was  a great phone.  Great  battery life.  Had a problem with constantly restarting which was eventually fixed by a software update. I upgraded my AT&T service to 5g. Didn't  work so I  went to an AT&T store to fix. They said it's the phone.
Mr. Tropical,5.0 out of 5 stars,You don't have to waste $1K on a new phone,Verified Purchase,"Forget the hype over the expensive, bank-breaking phones.  The S20 FE is the next best thing, performs extremely well, takes great photos and video and does just about all the phones costing much more will do.  The best part is you get to keep a few bucks in your pocket."
Fred J.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice phoneO,Verified Purchase,"Overall I like this phone very much after a few weeks use. It replaced a Samsung Galaxy S7, so there was no particular learning curve.What I don't like is no fault of the hardware. The location and lock screen functions did not work well on the S7, and they don't on this phone either. That may be because of operator error."
Jimbo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Instant 5G Best phone I've ever owned.,Verified Purchase,I like the wireless charging capability. I transferred my old phone sim card for instant 5G. Some Samsung apps should be disabled and there are several good videos on YT for tweaking. I would highly recommend this 2022 version of the S21.
Madhungarian,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good UPDATE!!,Verified Purchase,"Phone works great, big improvement and upgrade from my ancient Galaxy S5 LOL.  Runs quick and is nice to not have the carriers bloatware installed.  Screen is sharp and bright, 120hz is also a plus. Been using my phone much more since upgraded to this.Update, if you want 5g to work with ATT Prepaid, make sure you update your IMEI number online or at the store."
"Sparks, Nevada",5.0 out of 5 stars,This phone will NOT work on T-Mobil 5G network.,Verified Purchase,We have two Samsung S20 Fe 5G smartphones. We purchase one directly from T-Mobile locked to T-Mobile we purchased this phone from Amazon unlocked. We had T-Mobile installed this phone on T-Mobile network. This phone will NOT connect to 5G T-Mobile network whereas the phone I purchased from T-Mobile will connect. All settings on both phones are identical.
Smbat Gevorgyan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Damaged phone instead of claimed ""used - like new""",Verified Purchase,"Â I bought it used - like new, however it is heavily used, having deep scratches and dents all over the body. In addition, it has multiple scratches on the screen that affect the usability.I brought this item to Armenia, and returning it would take several weeks. Therefore, I'd like to have a full refund for the phone."
OMGYourComments,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,Verified Purchase,Just a lil disappointed when they took the extra storage (SD card) away that was a big help on my older models! It's cool though
Anderson A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Close your eyes and buy it!,Verified Purchase,I have been using this phone for almost a month and it's amazing. It's superfast and smoothe. The battery life on this phone is really good. It also takes a short time to recharge.  The display is beautiful and my favorite feature is the dolby atmos sound that comes from both speakers. With the high refresh rate the battery life is still excellent.  A decision you would not regret. Buy it!
Dorian,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love this phone!!!,Verified Purchase,"I can't downplay the reviews from other users because their opinions and needs are different than mine. I almost did not purchase because of certain reviews but I'm glad I did because so far this phone has been amazing. I came from a Moto G5s plus and I can see a big difference already, in a good way. There are a few features I will have to get used to, but I can adapt. The only downside so far is only having 3 fingerprints to use to unlock your phone, but that's minor. I definitely recommend. In my opinion, you won't be disappointed."
Heather Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone but not sure if it's better enough for the price tag,Verified Purchase,I like the phone overall. it is pretty speedy and the battery life is very good. I am not a camera connoisseur so I can't comment on whether the camera is all that it's supposed to be but it seems good. I will say that both the fingerprint reader and the face recognition our spotty at best. I often need to use my unlock code but that is easy. I've only had it a couple of months but so far so good. I am not sure that it is worth the extra money over a phone that's about half the price for someone who doesn't really use the camera.
Ali Mahzrnia,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alright,Verified Purchase,"I needed to do a factory reset to get the GPS working, but now it's okay! 4 stars because it was very confusing and no one in Samsung/Amazon/UbrrakIfix could not find the fix after few days until I did a factory reset on my own."
K. Paglia,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ehh,Verified Purchase,I switched from the Samsung A12 to this. I was sent one of these phones and realized quickly that the battery life was not good. My old phone had a better battery. So I sent it back and got another sent. This seems to have slightly better battery but wont last me all day. I can get through probably 8 or 9 hours of on and off use on this phone before having to charge. Considering I got it on sale I would say the $100 dollar savings compensates for this but still a little upset.
Alex Y. YoonTop Contributor: Running,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Well made Samsung Galaxy phone, but it has some glitches.",Verified Purchase,"Samsung is the second biggest name in the phone and this one is pretty good one.Everything works perfect and responsive until I ran into a glitch of the screen going dark once in a while. And I have to restart to reboot.  Perhaps I got a lemon, but I contacted Amazon and they took care of the problem by refunding it immediately, after my return of the phone."
J. Ligon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty darn good!,Verified Purchase,I purchased this phone for a replacement for my Motorola X4. I liked the color so decided not to buy a case however the phone is so slick that it kept sliding off various surfaces so I am waiting for my new clear case case to arrive. Fingerprint reader is very quick but the facial recognition is sporadic particularly compared to my daughters Apple 12. Speed is very good and the 90htz refresh is good but it eats more battery so I would switch to 60htz if not gaming. Power off icon is more difficult to use than it should be.
Kfire,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So close, and yet so far",Verified Purchase,"I like the idea of this phone, take last year's flagship processor and build a cheaper quality phone around it. In practice, this is a 200$ xiaomi phone with worse cameras and batteries.In performance and network features this thing is great. The ram and processor are great, so why did you slap these inferior 12mp grainy cameras on! Ya'll even put in an SD card slot!Good lord this could have been the phone to DESTROY this mid range market... But Samsung missed it by a hair!Honestly if it had a better camera and an aux port I would have been recommending it to everyone who had any care for phones and tech... But not with this 500$ poco phone equivalent with worse camera"
D Hawk 12,3.0 out of 5 stars,Camera leaves a bit to be desired. Or a lot.,Verified Purchase,"I've always been happy with Samsung smartphones. After a lot of research, primarily focused on the camera and video capabilities, I went with this one. Oops. It does not follow action well and is a step down from my prior Samsung S10+. I use this for my everyday, but for pictures and video streaming I pulled out my old phone. My daughter also says the selfie mode is lacking."
K1nnngggg Tai,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best flagship phone for the money!,Verified Purchase,4 months ago I bought this and it works really well. No missing features or glitches. I use AT&T with 5g and it works really well. Camera is really nice. Snapdragon 865 is extremly fast! It came with a standard 15w charger but I had a spare 25w charger lying around. My only regret was I wish I had gotten the white colored one but wasn't in stock at the time.
Nir_M,3.0 out of 5 stars,iPhone wannabe in all cheap aspects,Verified Purchase,"Cost saving (or false claim of earth saving) measures means no charger in the box with the phone.Has no audio jack. one can waste money on USB-C headphones or fancy bluetooth set.All the nasty features I hated in latest iPhone, Samsung has copied.No fingerprint biometrics, means while driving if you want to open the phone for some reason... HOW?Camera is good as usual. Was never a fan of Samsung apps. Meh phone."
JosÃ© Ãngel Badilla Granados,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best ""Flagship Killer"" from Samsung",Verified Purchase,"It's an pretty solid phone:+ Has pro features:  * Fast charging compatibility  * Wireless charging  * Fast refresh screen at 120hz+ It makes the correct compromises:  * Plastic rear with a nice finish, doesn't feel cheap  * No curve screen (for some people its a plus)- Cons:  * The included charger isn't the fast charger that matches the phone capability.  * Doesn't include any extras:  * No phone case  * No earphones  * No USB-C to headphone jack converter"
Roxanne Soltis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend Samsung S20 fe!,Verified Purchase,"I went from a Samsung 7 edge to a Google pixel 3 thinking I would have better pictures and a better phone. After 2 years of not being happy with pixel I chose  Samsung S20 fe. I love this phone! Cameras are above expectations as well as all other aspects of the phone. Very responsive and easy to use. Goodbye  Google Pixel 3. Only issue would be I thought I was buying a new phone, I have been unable to verify if refurbished.  Box was sealed, a little dirty but phone was clean. I highly recommend Samsung S20 fe!"
The Hornsby Household,5.0 out of 5 stars,New member of Team Samsung,Verified Purchase,"I'm in love with this phone,  and I'm not even a phone person.  I had grown increasingly unimpressed by the IPhone family of phones. I have an acquaintance who has the Note, and I began researching Samsung products.  The picture is so vivid when I play a video,  the camera is wonderful. I could go on and on... I think I'm sold on the Samsung mobile phone line!"
sally,5.0 out of 5 stars,New phone has a long battery life,Verified Purchase,I am loving my new phone. It takes a little time trying to get used to the new phone. The battery life is wonderful  compared to my galaxy 7 phone. I can not get the fingerprint reader to work for me. I'm trying the face recognition now.
Luz Rivera,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure what's up with Samsung this year,Verified Purchase,"I really looked forward to having a new Samsung. I loved the color, but unfortunately the speaker was not working well and neither was the camera when using the flash. When on a call I'd be talking and at random times the other person could not hear me at all. This also happened when I had them on speakerphone. Obviously, this is something very important when it comes to purchasing a phone: the other person must be able to hear you during the call. Next, when taking a photo with the flash in the photo came out really blue and foggy. However, if no flash was used during the day and or night mode the picture came out very nice. I also did notice that the phone's battery percentage would go down when not in use. I've never had these type of problems with any of the many Samsung phones I've owned. Hopefully the next one will be alot better as I do not plan on ever switching to an iPhone."
Vee Jay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Meets requirement,Verified Purchase,"Well, it's early days yet, however, unit functioning smoothly. Forgot to purchase SD card, though will not be in need for just now. Going through features, and will update review, at a later date. In the meanwhile, can easily recommend to others. Pricing could be somewhat  reduced, in reflection of other units observed within that price range. One dislike, the bloating of unessential apps., maybe to justify cost. IDK."
F. Chung,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works Nicely,Verified Purchase,Overall the phone works pretty well.  Biggest issue found so far is getting a good screen protector that works well with the fingerprint reader.  None of the tempered glass ones we tried worked well.  Ended up using a soft type.The biggest concern is OS updates from Samsung.  Compared to Apple as android phones don't seem to get updates promptly and support is not as long as an iPhone from what we can tell.
J. Campbell,3.0 out of 5 stars,DOES NOT WORK WITH US CELLULAR!,Verified Purchase,"Phone came ok, seemed previously opened but looked brand new. Arrived in time and all that but it will not work with US Cellular or Verizon (so they said) this is a GSA and us cellular and Verizon are CDMA. Still waiting for refund, 13 days later..."
Amanda A.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung products are they really the ""most durable""?",Verified Purchase,"I just got this phone 3 months ago and it fell put of my pocket (2ft. At most) and my screen completely shattered. As you can see from the pictures, my case took no damage. I called Samsung and they had no answer when I asked them about their  ""indestructible gorilla glass"". It would have cost me $265 to replace my screen. So now I am out the $599 it cost me for this phone and now another $399 to replace the entire phone. Honestly, for as poor of quality as Samsung is putting out there now I think my next phone will be with Apple."
Koko,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not serviceable until 2021-check your provider first!,Verified Purchase,"This phone has a lot of fun features and options, love the camera, and the white back doesn't show fingerprints. Unfortunately I'm not able to review some features of the phone because it is not yet serviceable. This is really up to the buyer to contact your service provider first, of course. Spectrum (specifically) does not service this unlocked device until sometime maybe in January 2021. Possibly to due with 5G service and it being a super new device. Just an FYI as we're now left with two brand new wonderful phones without service and two quickly dying old phones trying to hang in there another month."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Massive upgrade at an affordable price!!,Verified Purchase,"I did a lot of research before coming to a conclusion to purchase this particular phone and let me tell you, this phone is beyond perfect, a MASSIVE upgrade from my Samsung galaxy S6 edge+. The battery life is superb, the multiple options to customize the UI is amazing, the security that this phone provides is simply phenomenal. You as the user have full control on how you want your phone to behave. And to top it all off, at an affordable price! (Bought this phone when it was at $600 maybe you can get it at the same price or better) Why pay more for something similar when you can pay less for the same thing or better?"
E. Delligatti,5.0 out of 5 stars,Galaxy Android phone s21FE 5G,Verified Purchase,I got this phone to keep up with the technology of the cell phones. My S7 just got too slow and too outdated. It still works but it won't be long before it can't be updated or supported by the newest versions.I like everything about it.  Much faster for streaming.  Pro camera for pictures and video with editing. Lots more memory.  Etc.
Denise Stefko,1.0 out of 5 stars,Locked phones we can not use.,Verified Purchase,We ordered 2 phones cleared locked when it said in the description that they were unlocked.I spent 2 hours trying to get them to work before calling my carrier to find out they were locked. Amazon lied! We are buying less and less from them because of issues we've had. I called customer service only to get a rep I could barely understand because of the  language barrier. When I said I can't understand you she hung up on me.
SueC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!,Verified Purchase,It's everything I wanted and I'm very happy with it.  I have not been happy with the A51 I've been using and I'm thrilled that this phone works more like the old Galaxy that I had except better!!  It is also compatible with the Consumer Cellular network and I had no issues getting hooked up.  It's nice that it comes with the tool to remove a sim card.
Saad A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best smartphone I've owned that's not flagship,Verified Purchase,"I upgraded to this phone after my S8 died and boy do I love it.Had to get used to a bigger phone but otherwise the specs were awesomeIt's sleek, has a great camera, awesome processor and welcoming features abe UI. And for the price it comes,  it just begs to be loved. So happy with it. Def recommend as a cheaper alternative to S21"
Vanessa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent phone,Verified Purchase,"Excellent phone! Been using it for a month now it works perfect with my knock off carrier total wireless.. I have a car,  screen protector,  camera glass protector.  It's going to last me a long while."
Cognizant Consumer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works on Verizon but not on Xfinity.,Verified Purchase,I put in my old Verizon SIM card and it works! Much faster than my old Samsung J7V. Fast forward 3 months. I tried to switch to Xfinity (supposedly uses Verizon equipment) and the IMEI search said it is not compatible. I can switch to AT&T but they suck here.
RR,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased!,Verified Purchase,The camera is fantastic!  Many settings.  Exceptional pictures.  Love all the memory.  You can't go wrong with 1Terrabite with a sim card. Plus the memory of the phone.  The phone was perfect.  Brand new.  Came quick and easy set  up.  Very pleased!
Rajeev Prasad,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone but description does not match,Verified Purchase,"Here it advertises 8GB RAM, but RAM is 6GBAlso, Samsung's website says display is 3200x1440. But that is a lie too. Display is 1080x2400will return this phone. Shame on you Samsung (and Bezos).from website:Galaxy S20 FE 5G  6.5"" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED  HID Flat (120Hz)  Infinity-O Display (3200x1440)  407 ppi  HDR10+ certified  120Hz refresh rate support"
Albert Alejandro Martinez,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Failure to read the sim, with some programs",Verified Purchase,"I bought this phone so I could play Call of Duty Mobile. I was tempted to buy another terminal, specifically designed for that purpose. But in the end I decided on Samsung because of its style which is quite more refined and because, on paper, its characteristics were similar. A good chip and a good screen with a high cup of soda. Unfortunately, the phone has had some flaws. At first it was software. Problems with Google Play, with discord and now with reading the sim card. I have to restart the phone for calling, messaging and internet services to work. It's a shame. In addition, facial recognition and fingerprint reading software on screen is really bad. Finally, connectivity with accessories from brands other than Samsung is pretty bad. I have a Xiaomi wristband and the connection between the phone and the band and unstable. I must be opening the mifit app to perform the download of information constantly."
abbey chase,1.0 out of 5 stars,slowest phone ever,Verified Purchase,"this is the slowest phone I have ever had, it is constantly searching for a connection, or loading pages total piece of crap, picture and camera are average not worth the time setting up or buying"
Salazar Bogden,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought on sale and this phone punches above the price,Verified Purchase,"I like the phone a lot.  The fingerprint reader is almost as good a a dedicated button, but absolutely up to snuff for regular use. Facial recognition is good as well. I have had none of the touch screen bugs after 1 month of use.Phone is snappy and fast processing. 5G is awesome if it's available to you. (I'm on t-mobile)Camera is very good, love the 3x optical zoom.120hz is a bit of a battery drainer so I mostly use 60hz when I'm out and about.  With that I get all day use.Overall for the price this is a winner."
Whitney Ingram,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it ,Verified Purchase,"So, coming from a Galaxy S7 I'm obviously in love with this phone. I have zero complaints. If you customize your phone correctly you'll have more than enough battery life and it charges very fast.The camera is just phenomenal. The phone is light but sturdy, and very easy for me to read as someone in their 40s.I'm just very happy with it. I would suggest buying a case on Amazon at the same time because I couldn't find one anywhere in town since it's an FE."
Hapless Student,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing value for the price,Verified Purchase,"Can't beat the price for what you get with this phone! Love it!The camera is amazing, finger print reader is fine, and the speaker is loud. Fluent when browsing. Its like a corvette with world class performance at affordable price. Snapdragon 865, 6 gb ram, 4500 mah battery size, 6.5 inch screen with 120 hz display. Simply unbeatable for the price!!!"
corey nutter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone for the price...,Verified Purchase,"I like this phone so much that when mine was smashed intentionally into the concrete, it took two times at full human strength of a 6 foot tall man to make it not work anymore. I did not hesitate to replace it with the same SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G. The phone is great value for the money I spent. I also recommend this too. https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Samsung-Tempered-Protector-Scratch/dp/B08KFPG514/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_rp_c_2_5/144-6656309-3446512?pd_rd_w=9j7YN&pf_rd_p=c5176ee3-b609-4196-9e4e-395444c24cf6&pf_rd_r=BDX5XCHK1A6WH7VR80A1&pd_rd_r=51830fd5-f828-4c59-b33e-a7d6c5e8e88d&pd_rd_wg=3qwHk&pd_rd_i=B08KFPG514&psc=1"
KATHY PICKETT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone for the Price,Verified Purchase,"Really like this phone. Upgraded from the Samsung A50. The S 21FE 5 G is just a hair bigger, but is actually lighter and packs a whole lot of features into its size. Got the model with the 128 MB and it works amazing. The camera is great, sharp and clear and battery life is easily all day even using it a lot. It has facial recognition and a finger print reader which is much better than the A 50. The only down side it will not run an app that we specifically got the phones for, the DEXCOM 6G app to read blood sugars. I think the app hasn't been updated for the newest phones.Over all very pleased with the phones and the price."
David,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was worried about ordering from a reseller,Verified Purchase,"You're always taking a gamble when you're ordering from a reseller, and it's always the luck of the draw on what you'll get. I'm a full-on nerd and would notice anything wrong or glitchy about a phone not to mention the way it looks... In my case I got an impeccable phone that performs impeccably and I couldn't be happier...My advice is to take the chance on this reseller and buy your phone. If it ends up being crap you can always send it back because you're buying from Amazon"
Shalim,2.0 out of 5 stars,Defected,Verified Purchase,I had a green tint when i would put the brightness below below 20% probably which would make other apps have a kind of gray and blurry view on the phone. After reading the comments i disregarded them because I knew about the phone but unfortunately I got a defected one . My mom and uncle got the same phone and theirs are fine and work great but i think I'll buy a different phone after returning. I noticed it right after the box so I personally didn't get to experience the phone for more then an hour before boxing it up again.
KumboochaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung S21 FE 5G Unlocked 128GB,Verified Purchase,"Great phone. Before this, I had the Samsung S8. The S8 was great, until the market stopped 3G service. This is why I purchased the S21 phone. 4G and 5G capable. Works great on AT&T/Cricket Wireless network. Fingerprint reader is great. QR Code reader is great. If I have any issues I'll return and update this review."
Jasmine,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of Money,Verified Purchase,I got this phone hoping that it would be a good phone also for the certified qpad fast charger.  Didn't not work work the charger.  Phone kept getting hot even when I was not on the phone more than 10 mins. Stopped charging and took 3 hrs to charge.  Liked the phone very much hated it had so much wrong with it for the expensive price it is.
Ray,4.0 out of 5 stars,A nice phone,Verified Purchase,After two months use the only problem I have is the lack of a slot for expandable memory. The video is clean and crisp and the speaker is good enough that I can hear it even with my bad hearing. The camera works well and takes nice photos. Would I buy it again? No because by the time I need a new phone this will be obsolete.
Tracey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible Phone,Verified Purchase,"I had to upgrade my phone when AT&T went to the 5g network.  I purchased this phone for $600.This phone has been shorted in every feature: camera quality, device connectivity, security features (face recognition and fingerprint recognition),  sound quality, and charging time when you don't use their special cables.  The phone is slower than my previous phone.I will return this phone and try and different Samsung or go to Apple."
Ronald Finnerty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, fair price",Verified Purchase,"Wifes old samsung s8 required charging all the time.very inconvenient and annoyed her.Bought her this with more memory, more storage, better hardware. It stays charged all the time. Worth every penny. She makes her living on the phone with her business, she doesnt complain anymore about her phone-priceless."
ersan ardic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good investment,Verified Purchase,"Touch screen cannot be zoomed, over heats and does not fast charge while on wireless charging. I had a S9+ Before this  after buying this I felt like I downgraded instead of upgrading."
Jerzee Gurl,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updated Review--Great Phone,Verified Purchase,"The two reviews below are from the first two times I attempted to purchase and use this phone. Third time was the charm. The Bluetooth works fine, and I'm loving this phone!----------------The phone is very attractive, the sound quality is good, and the screen is large and the picture clear. But I had nothing but trouble trying to get my Bluetooth devices to hook up with it. After trying unsuccessfully to find a fix (both from Samsung and my auto manufacturer), and having to reboot by Fitbit multiple times today, I got so aggravated that I returned it (August 2020)I purchased this phone a second time (April 2021), hoping Samsung would have fixed the Bluetooth issues in the meantime. They have not. Again, I tried multiple solutions from multiple sources, from user groups to the manufacturer. But really, at these prices, should I have to do research to make it do something it's supposed to do anyway? I really wanted to love this phone, but it is useless to me unless the Bluetooth works with my car."
Sara B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worked fine with AT&T,Verified Purchase,"We were looking for new phones and got these on prime day.  We didn't even have to get a new sim card, so there was no hassle whatsoever.  We just traded the cards ans transferred the stuff on our phones over.  So far so good.  I am not as impressed as I thought I would be with battery life as my old phone which is a little bit of a disappointment, but otherwise they work fine so far"
Joshua,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great daily phone,Verified Purchase,"I bought this during amazon prime day to replace mu google pixel 3a. It's great, there's nothing else to say about it. Face id works great, fingerprint reader works great, fast processor, great streaming quality (if you know what i mean ), and camera is pretty good, nothing compared to flagship phones but it's still better then most phones. Overall, 8/10, 8 because though everything else is good, it can't run high end games, like Genshin Impact."
Daniel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good,Verified Purchase,It meets most of my expectations it's a very smooth and quick phone. I haven't seen any of the issues stated yet though I will say the battery doesn't hold as long as was stated and the only issue I've had so far is my phone kept freezing when I would click on the wifi button and when I went to restart the phone it wouldn't turn back on after 20mins. It's fine now but time will tell.
Nikki Silverwolf,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointment,Verified Purchase,"Phone has mind of its own. Closes apps while using them. Have call apps to identify and block private numbers no matter the app or membership type it doesn't not do what it should. Battery life drains very fast.  Tells me my passwords and thumbprint don't match . Key board does what it wants. Example: if I type cat, the keyboard will do this caaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I type correct spelling and it autocorrects to  sjsksbejdjsksns. So disappointed I'm thinking of switching to apple"
Andres C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best phone on the market,Verified Purchase,"Legitimately love this phone, probably my favorite phone so far. It's lightweight, thin, sturdy build, fingerprint reader and face unlock work tremendously well. Comes with Android 12 out the box, cameras are amazing. Processor is smooth and amazing all day battery. Overall, perfect phone. It's a Samsung, so you can't expect anything but the best."
Joan Phillips,3.0 out of 5 stars,Has some issues on my phone,Verified Purchase,What I  don't like is that yahoo.com freezes on my phone. It doesn't do it on any of my other electronics.  My phone has more than enough space and memory. It only happens on this app. I have to charge my phone daily. Maybe it's because I use it for everything instead of using my laptop.
Robby Boy,5.0 out of 5 stars,PERFECT PHONE,Verified Purchase,Bought 1 year ago. This Samsung FE20 5G does everything perfectly! !Best phone I ever had. Have owned 9 phones in last 18 years. Not one single issue.Samsungs  are awesome !
Mia Palombo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Inferior to LG G7,Verified Purchase,"I had LG phones for a number of years. They worked very well, but had problems, and didnât last that long.Replaced with this Samsung S20FE. Right away, I can tell that this Samsung is inferior. Issues with face recognition, fingerprints, finding downloads, talk to text is terrible, etc. etc. My only hope is that it lasts like three years."
Michael Tavalese,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect smartphone,Verified Purchase,This phone is everything it says it would be. The battery last almost 3 days with moderate use. The signal is almost always full bars everywhere I go. The stereo speakers on the phone are a big plus with gaming. The screen refresh rate on it is crazy good. Perfect smartphone
Juliebug,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not come with charger or cord,Verified Purchase,Really a $600 phone does not include a charger or a USB cord! Very poorly done!
justbought,2.0 out of 5 stars,The side of the phone appears dirty,Verified Purchase,"It is suppose to be a brand new phone, but the one I received appears to have something dirtyalong one corner of the phone. All other parts look fine. Functions are fine so far.Will monitor the phone. It is disgrace for Amazon and Samsung to sell used phone as new!"
Cody Prentice,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone but has one problem,Verified Purchase,"Everything about the phone is great for the most part. However, the phone has problems charging after I purchased a fast charging cable which oddly enough, isn't even listed on Amazon anymore. I plugged it in once and now the phone has problems charging even with the cable included with the phone. Very disappointing that I need to struggle just to get it to charge."
Michael,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love,Verified Purchase,I love the Samsung galaxy s20 fe 5g. I love the color. The size is great. I love the camera quality it is like I have a dslr camera. The video quality is fantastic. The processor in the phone is so fast to respond.  I love the fingerprint sensor. I give thus phone 5 stars.
AJohnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life and camera are a major upgrade!!,Verified Purchase,I love my new Samsung galaxy s21 bc I'm a simple man. I have simple needs and also bc I had my s9 plus for like 3 and half years. Great upgrade for the price couldn't find a better price anywhere just make sure you know who your carrier is and have a current Sim card to switch it over. Battery life is great authenticity is perfect. If you're an android person get this phone.
Vidman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well-built and functions well,Verified Purchase,"Upgraded from a Galaxy S9, no surprises. Phone works as it should, and audio is clear. Battery life between charges is good.I recommend this phone"
F P Gar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung great phones,Verified Purchase,I've always had Samsung phones love them.  I made a big mistake when ordering this phone i didn't follow the instructions and lost out on the trade-in.
Jody,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome phone,Verified Purchase,"Great product dont forget to change the setting to sensitive finger print reader if you have a glass case. Great phone my fiancee love it, its fast and it charges other phone if needed."
roberto ledesma valverde,4.0 out of 5 stars,relatively satisfied,Verified Purchase,"The cell phone case came open, it may have been checked in customs, at least that I want to think; all the accessories were there, so far everything is going great with the equipment. Hopefully I don't have any problems after the 90 days amazon gives me. Fast shipping, although internally UPS takes a bit to deliver it to me. Thank you"
Andres Morgado,5.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung phone,Verified Purchase,Awesome product very satisfied especially with the camera features I recommend it very highly I will buy it again if I had to!
estefania,4.0 out of 5 stars,"No headphone jack, buy adaptor or Bluetooth headphones. Overall NICE.",Verified Purchase,"Beware of no headphone jack, solution: buy an adapter. I panicked at firts because I don't like be charging constantly Bluetooth headphones. The phone is beatifull designed and the images and photos won't disappoint. But for the prize should include the adaptor and headphones.I just got it so I may update again."
Issoufou Sabo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice picture on this,Verified Purchase,So far so good after over a month of use. Camera is very good and clear. Battery could be better Two charge a day for normal use.Finger print works flow less
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,Verified Purchase,When I  took the clear plastic off of the front screen protector it had some dust on it and when I tried to clean it the finger print circle got some dust on it and I tried to fix it but that only made it worse. I think there should be something in the instructions that says whatever you do don't touch that spot. Now I have to send it back and my phone will be unprotected until the new case comes.
ohsuzyq,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Decent Phone,Verified Purchase,Going from an older IPhone to this Android has proven to be a bit of a learning curve for a senior citizen.  We purchased this phone because it was hearing aid compatible.  We've had a bit of problem syncing the phone and the hearing aids but that may be more the app than the phone.  It has a great battery life and the camera is good.
Girlie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not gonna order any electronics on amazon,Verified Purchase,I ordered this phone for my husband and then when it came we went to metro to turn the phone on.. but the problem is they put the card and everything and when you try to  make a call it doesn't work it keeps saying no simcard he did everything to make the phone work but nothing happened.. it says its factory unlocked when i ordered.. so i returned it on 21st of last month and i just want a refund but still didn't got it it's been two weeks..
Debra L Rench,5.0 out of 5 stars,Useful,Verified Purchase,I love my Samsung fan edition.  It does absolutely everything I need to use it for.  It did not come with a user manual (fortunately I bought a book that showed me wonderful short cuts and useful information)  I did have one incident of overheating with no obvious cause.  I turned it off and did not use it for several hours.  It has not done it again.  Battery life is exceptional!
Cristal,2.0 out of 5 stars,Phone has touch screen and functional issues,Verified Purchase,"This phone has functional and touchscreen issues. Had to be pressing several times in order for it to recognize the touch, it has functional issues even after the phone is updated and overall was not a good experience. It felt like an old phone though ut was brand new. Very frustrating! Not recommended."
William,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely the best value phone!,Verified Purchase,"The FE additions to Galaxy phones gives you most all of the high end features without the high end cost! Great cameras, easy to use and a great phone like all Samsung Galaxy phones. Finally replaced my trusty S7 edge with this phone.Change over from old apps to this phone could not be easier."
Ellie Wheeler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super Great Phone for the Price!,Verified Purchase,"Great phone so far! The technological differences can be seen in comparison to my old S8+. The Samsung S20 FE is way faster, the cameras are way better, and it looks way cleaner.Crazy how affordable this phone is for what you get from it. Definitely would recommend!"
Arty,2.0 out of 5 stars,Flaky keyboard,Verified Purchase,"Battery life is great, so far. Finger recognition is hit or miss, often taking several tries before the phone will come to life. Bluetooth connectivity dropped more than my old phone did, for the first few months I  owned the phone.  Keystrokes are misleads a lot more than my older S5 and Moto X4 phones from 2015 and 2018."
Cali N,2.0 out of 5 stars,Its alright,Verified Purchase,"Its a really pleasant looking phone, the camera is pretty good, I've gotten some really nice pictures out of it but it's kinda a pain in my @ss. The screen is super touchy and it'll think I'm touching something when my hands aren't even on it. The battery life is solid and the call quality is nice. I don't think it's worth 600$ and honestly I preffered my old galaxy j7 but unfortunately it broke and the only thing I could do was upgrade. Overall it's a decent phone, works fine, just a bit annoying and not very friendly for non tech savvy people."
Ashley Sanchez,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT PHONE!!! very satisfied with this purchase,Verified Purchase,"Before I bought this phone I was a bit skeptical because of the reviews people wrote. But to my surpise it works just fine. I put in my sim card from my other phone it connected to my at&t service with no problem, the battery life is great, and the camera is awesome. I would only say i wish i had got the cool mint. But for anyone having doubts, my other phone was the galaxy zflip an that phone was a headache, this phone is way better thumbs up!  "
Loonyj,3.0 out of 5 stars,There are some things they don't tell you about the 20FE.,Verified Purchase,"The phone does not have visual voicemail mail.  You can't pull up the phone see who left you messages!  That totally blows.  Deal breaker, had I known.The phone comes with a micro card slot, and takes up to 1 TB cards.  Try that Apple.Battery life is great.Also the contact charger, erases the card.  Doh!I would not purchase again!"
D.X. Zhang,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Deal for the Quality,Verified Purchase,"The 2020 Black Friday price ($549) made Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G a great deal at Amazon. It is a function-rich phone with good quality. Everything works as expected. I have no problem with it so far. It does feel a little bulky and heavy, needing some time to get use to it."
AAA,2.0 out of 5 stars,Best camera on a worst phone,Verified Purchase,"I gifted this to my husband. He works from home and mostly uses phone to be on webex meetings or conference calls atleast once a day for work reports. This phone hangs up/gets disconnected suddenly which never happened with his old phone. When he tries to reconnect to the call, he did not get connected. Sound quality is also not up to the mark. I gave two stars just for camera quality. Battery dies faster compared to his old phone. He switched back to his old phone, and I'm returning this. I bought S22+ for him which is arriving shortly."
jessica,5.0 out of 5 stars,AWSOME,Verified Purchase,"This phone is THE BOMB!! I absolutely love it . Although, I am upgrading from a Samsung galaxy S7... kinda a big upgrade, but I can tell you, this phone is worth it. I loads fast, its stylish, and it comes in many colors. The only issue I've had is I can't find many good cases for the phone in store around me. This phone at the moment is still kinda new, so finding a good case can be a little bit of a challange."
A812,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great all-round phone,Verified Purchase,"The reviews are right. This is an awesome phone. People say its great for the money but that I feel degrades the perception associated with it. This phone does everything I need it to do but be advised the speakers seem a little soft, the fingerprint scanner is a little laggy. The batter however  is a monster . Nothing to complain about. Love this device I think I made a smart choice"
Justin E,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good battery life,Verified Purchase,I had my s20 on standby before switching my service over. It lasted 10 days. Battery life with regular use last about a day and a half.
Serby ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value flagship.,Verified Purchase,The Samsung FE 5G is a great device. Face unlock is not as fast as the OnePlus 7T and other one Plus devices. The 865 snapdragon is more than enough processing power you will ever need. Great display altho wish it had gorilla glass 5 or 6 vs the older Gorilla glass 3 version . Put on a case and screen protector and you will love the brilliant display and solid performance
Willem R. Vandenberge,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone for a good price,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to replace the Pixel 3aXL I dropped. This is fine phone with excellent 5G features that has most of the features of the new premium phones for less than half the cost. It does come with the usual amount of Samsung crapware pre-installed, which was expected. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase."
William,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutly love!,Verified Purchase,"What a great phone and value. If you're looking for a flagship phone minus just a very few bells and whistles look no further. This phone is amazing, fast and has a great camera and features. Came unlocked as advertised. Did the transfer from my old S7 by myself with no problems. Highly recommended! Saved a lot of money!!!"
June Moon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Camera has black screen only (inoperable) in  less than 1 year,Verified Purchase,"Screen is totally black while in the camera app. but fine to use with other apps. Screen is not damaged and not misaligned, and it happened overnight--worked one day and not the next. I feel Samsung has NO customer service. Totally unhappy since the camera was the main reason I bought this phone. Apple will be my next phone I guess."
Aimee Quella,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't Work with US Cellular,Verified Purchase,"We bought this phone and took it into US Cellular and they said it is NOT compatible with their network. Very disappointed, don't know if I should be upset with US Cellular or Samsung. Unsure."
Grace,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pictures, tons of internal storage",Verified Purchase,"I was in search of a new phone. One with more storage and better camera abilities. Samsung, as always, had just what I needed. I can now have my photography apps on my phone. And you can use SD card for additional storage (I like to save my pictures there). The camera is great... and there are more photo/video options then my last phone."
Code Red,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands down the best phone for your buck.,Verified Purchase,"This is the best Samsung phone to date. It's the same feeling I felt when I got the Note 4 and S8+ years ago even though there are features in Note 4 and S8+ that aren't in S20 FE like taking your oxygen saturation which is important for me during pandemic, but still the phone is so good that you can forgive Samsung for not including that feature."
Alex Rodriguez,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's legit,Verified Purchase,"I was afraid it might be a fake, so I would have returned it. But this is very real. I have this phone for 7 months or more and it's for sure worth it. The camera quality is insane. That's what everyone tells me who I show my phone to. Battery life is awesome too. It can last you a whole day from 100 percent. From 70 percent it can last you 5 hours or more depending how much you use it. It's definitely worth it. I haven't used facial recognition so I couldn't tell you. But the finger print reader is really good."
Walt321,2.0 out of 5 stars,worst Samsung Galaxy I've owned to date,Verified Purchase,"Phone is not impressive in anyway. Touch screen is horrible, the battery life is the worst I've ever had.  Lack of a headphone jack still pisses me off as well.100% wish I did not buy. Usually keep phones for 3-4 years. This one wont even last a year I know it already."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Transferred old to new by myself!,Verified Purchase,For a non-tech phone person this phone is great. The battery life is superb.  I have been using an android phone since my 1st smart phone. More specifically Samsung. This is my 3rd Galaxy phone and it just keeps getting better and easier to use.
L. R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,"The fingerprint sensor works, the stereo speakers are awesome. I got the cloud white, love it. The amoled screen is beautiful. Phone is fast at everything it does. Great investment, you will not be disappointed."
Charlie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Faster phone,Verified Purchase,This size is perfect. Fast processing. On screen finger print recognition great. I miss not having an led showing battery charger status and flashing led when I missed a call. Screen shots are no longer power & vol buttons but swiped palm across screen.
Richard,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't make them like they used to,Verified Purchase,"Upgrading from an S8 and disappointed to see the multifunction rgb led is discontinued, it lacks a blood O2 and pulse sensor, it's significantly bigger screen and weight. But this is the closest I could find with micro SD and a decent processor that's also 5G. My S8 lasted a solid 4 years I just don't see this one doing the same."
Jay,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just Plain Doesn't Work,Verified Purchase,"Friends and family call me, phone only rings occasionally.  Drops calls all the time. Search Google, phone locks up. Very slow.  I am using WIFI and WIFI calling with strong WIFI signal.  Same thing happens on cell service.  Did I get a Lemon phone?  It's been over 30 days so How do I get my money back??"
andrew weaver,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Photos, apps and awesomeness",Verified Purchase,"Have had this phone for about 2 months now and nothing but happy! Has good speed on our wireless network, clear calls, better photos than I ever expected from a phone!Not even a little regretful about this purchase."
gldsooner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable Price for a High End Phone,Verified Purchase,"This replaced a Samsung Galaxy S6 which was good for years but didn't last long on a charge anymore.Great screen and camera, lots of advanced features, and excellent battery life.  I transferred everything over from the old S6 with the Samsung SmartSwitch program over the network and that worked perfectly."
Kenett Garcia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,Verified Purchase,"What can I say, if you looking for a phone to last and with all the newest technology that the 1000 dollar phone have, then this is the one. It does everything great and for the price it's amazing. I picked it up for 550 brand new and I'm Happy with my purchase samsung."
MBuyer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth & Voice don't work,Verified Purchase,"Bluetooth don't work will not sync. Voice command is retarded, it will some times make the correct words and then re-change them to something stupid. ALSO will will Stop recording in mid sentence, after about two seconds. MAJOR REGRET buying this phone. Very little i like about this phone so far.. my old phone was great (Not Samsung)."
Samx50,5.0 out of 5 stars,What I've been waiting for!,Verified Purchase,"This phone hit almost all the checkmarks I had for a new phone. Besides the price, on sale for $549 on cyber Monday, it has a flat screen and no glass in the back - main reasons I stayed away from a regular S20.. It's also larger than the S20.. Performance is great; it's fast, has a great display, and a very responsive finger print reader.. Very pleased so far! Knock wood!"
klee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst purchase ever, scam",Verified Purchase,Received refurbished phone instead of new. Definitely doesnât work transferring from sprint to T-Mobile.  Definitely a pain in the butt.  Went out of town so missed the return window.  Rip off
Muhammad imran,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome speed, great camera, love the phone!",Verified Purchase,"I used samsung phones all my life, infact my first smartphone was of samsung with google logo at its back. And this is my first S series samsung phone and I loved it! I always had issues with the phone speed, but this one's pretty great and with 256 GB of the memory with factory unlocked, the price is great! All in all totally worth the buy!"
TeresaTop Contributor: Pets,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice phone,Verified Purchase,"My only complaint is that I bought this when it was the latest technology.  A couple of weeks after I bought it they came out with the S-21.  How are we supposed to stay up to date when they push them out so fast.  Having said that, I got the FE edition.  I haven't seen any difference than what the other versions offer.  It's just less expensive."
Nathan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grameat flagship level performance,Verified Purchase,"This phone is fantastic. Coming from an lg g7, this screen is incredible. Super smooth and bright. The performance of the phone is very fast and being a Samsung, you get awesome features like super fast charging. And the battery life is great. For the price, I would recommend this to anyone, esp people who don't like the pricetag on phones these days."
Ela,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not Read Sim card,Verified Purchase,Does not read sim card.  I got the same phone from my cell provider and it works great and read the sim perfectly.  Just pay a few dollars more and get one that works.  NOT THIS ONE.2/6/21 UPDATE:  I sent this phone back 2 months ago and STILL HAVE NO REFUND.  I have contacted the seller and amazon with not even so much as a response back.  Buyer beware!
M,1.0 out of 5 stars,Right after the 30 day window for returns it broke.,Verified Purchase,Loved it at first but then a line randomly shows up spanning the length of the display and refuses to go away. So.etimes it's pink. Sometimes it's green. Either way it is completely unacceptable and ruins the whole thing.
CrazyLarry,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Samsung phone in years,Verified Purchase,"I've been buying Samsung phones for over 10 years.  This one is terrible.... way too big...I jab be large hands and need 2 to hold it... will not fit in your pocket. Very heavy, battery lasts 1.5 days brand new out of the box.  The camera that was raved about is only slightly better than my old s7."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good New Phone,Verified Purchase,This phone sold at a much better price than any of the other places I looked.The battery life is really good.  After heavy use there was still 50% battery at the end of the day.My wireless company was very helpful in getting it set up and transferring all the data.The old phone was getting tired and slow.  This one is much faster
genegenre,3.0 out of 5 stars,"photos are mediocre, auto rotate sticks. Mostly a good phone outside of that.",Verified Purchase,"It's no I-phone but I don't like Apple and their inferior design quirks for the sake of being different. Stay away from Google Pixel btw. Yeah, this will do until I cave and drink that apple flavored kool-aid some day"
B. J. Hurst,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life,Verified Purchase,"I needed to replace my old phone and this one was recommended by my son in law. Haven't tried the face recognition or the fingerprint reader yet, but the battery life is good. Was a little hesitant on the price though, only because I don't use my phone much, mostly for games, social media and  internet.  I did find one for a good price though."
Bird House Lady,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far it has been just fine,Verified Purchase,Battery life is good and WAY more storage and memory than my old phone. But no plug for my earbuds and I don't like the wireless type earbuds.
elizabeth,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,Verified Purchase,"Purchased this online since it was a little cheaper than going into tmobile- its awful. I've had nothing but problems with it. It freezes, won't let me make phone calls, tells me randomly I don't have a Sim card, and nothing seems to work properly. Not worth it"
Ikaika,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fortnite compatible,Verified Purchase,For the price it's OK. Fingerprint reader is just ok. Battery life is great. I wish it had dual front speakers. I like that it has expandable storage. Samsung apps store has the Epic app with Fortnite. It also has a FREE app to watch select movies and shows. (Walking dead included with ads)
Andhonor,2.0 out of 5 stars,NOTE:  These Will Not Work With Xfinity Mobile,Verified Purchase,"The reviews say this phone will work with Xfinity mobile.  Not true, I spent over an hour with Xfinity rep, and they found out the only S20 that will work, are ones they sell.  No other unlocked Samsung S20 phones will work with them."
ben,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best phone ever.,Verified Purchase,"This phone is a great phone. Even being ""renewed"" it was in right out of the box condition. Had issues trying to figure out why it wouldn't upgrade to 5g service(because I'm using my Samsung so sim card). Truly an excellent phone at an excellent price. It takes great photos too. The phot of the moon was taken at max zoom."
NAT,1.0 out of 5 stars,Phone didnt work and I had to pay to ship it back.,Verified Purchase,Phone didnt work and I had to pay to ship it back.
debra,1.0 out of 5 stars,sucks,Verified Purchase,my refurbished phone is less than a week old and apps are crashing.  yes i cleared all the caches.calls with headphones are terrible and echo-y.i havent had it long enough to discover new problems
LAURA GORBY,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely recommended!,Verified Purchase,"There are so many great features to this phone! Battery life is amazing, very user friendly, Great value for the money. Most phone companies want $700-$1000 for this phone  So much technology for the price and the amount of storage is A+++I haven't used the face recognition yet."
Milan,2.0 out of 5 stars,A lot of issues,Verified Purchase,"Returning my Samsung s20 FE 5g.Maybe I just got lemon, but my phone got frozen screen 5,6 times in first two weeks and than reboots, not acceptable for new phone and 6gig ram. Also fingerprint reader is horrible, face unlock works good though.Battery life not what expected for 4500mh.Touchscreen is not always responsive, especially on the corners of the screen.Thing that I liked is great display/resolution.I would stay away from this phone, on paper everything seems amazing, in reality too many issues."
J. Prevot,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Weak phone, weak battery",Verified Purchase,The fingerprint reader works well. Other features are glitchy. The battery life is terrible.
Pershopper,3.0 out of 5 stars,Does not come with a SIM card. I have tried three different cards at Verizon.  Nope.,Verified Purchase,Terrible that this phone comes With no SIM card. Obviously youâre ordering a phone for the next day because of emergencies. Two days later weâre still at Verizon trying to get the Sim card set up. Will be returning
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great budget S20 FE Android phone,Verified Purchase,The best Android phone that I ever had. Samsung S20 fe phone rivals the iPhone 12. I'm done with IPhones. The battery last all day to night time. Very responsive and more features than I expected. Great budget phone
Elloo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,"This replaced my very cheapie moto G6, which was ok, but the charging port was getting wonky and not worth fixing. This is a faster phone for downloads. A bigger screen. Not light in weight. Still getting used to it, but I like this S20 so far. It was a very good deal on Prime Day."
Joe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Galaxy S20 FE,Verified Purchase,By far the best phone we've ever had. Great photos. I doubt I'll ever figure out how to use it to it's full capabilities. Thanks Samsung.
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Screen goes black!,Verified Purchase,"This phone is terrible. The screen randomly goes black all the time, in all applications. Happens during texting, in email, search engines, social media apps, games. I will be returning it as soon as I can figure out which one to replace it with. Also, every time the black screen flashes it does a hit on the battery life. Have lost nearly 60% battery power in six hours, and I've had this phone less than two weeks. It was new in the box when purchased."
T. Milligan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worthwhile Upgrade,Verified Purchase,Purchased unlock S20 5G FE as an upgrade from an old S8. Great deal at just $450 each. Battery life is considerably better and the speed access apps is lightning fast. Easy upgrade that was straight-forward. So far so good.
Lois,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Too Big to be a phone, more like a tablet",Verified Purchase,"It is sooooooo BIG! Likens to Get Smarts shoe phone. I have a tablet and I wanted a phone. This is too big for my hand, my pocket, my purse-- it is just too big. Returned the phone and waiting for my refund. I've decided on a Z Flip. Please, please, please make small phones."
Billy,1.0 out of 5 stars,The touch screen doesn't work,Verified Purchase,"I have an issue with touching the screen too. I always miss calls due the touch phone doesn't work when I try to answer the phone. Thought that my finger touched or swipe not correctly. Now just reading the one-star rating seeing that others have the same problem. Supposed to return it, but the window return is passed a few days. What's a bumper!"
Austin & Rachel,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's pretty good,Verified Purchase,Coming from a pixel 2xl this was a big upgrade for both me and my wife. It is great with the one exception that sometimes the touch screen bugs out and I need to restart it. It's maybe once a week it does that. Otherwise it is a really great phone with great performance and battery life especially at the price it is sold at.
Trill,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a really nice phone,Verified Purchase,There's nothing I don't like about this phone so far. I did have a problem getting my email set up I had to go to my carrier to get help and all is good now. Hoping to have good luck with it for quite some time.
Paola Martinez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone especially for the price.,Verified Purchase,"Got this phone for my teen and she loves it, well worth the price. The box itself did come like pictured and the phone was dusty as a result but the phone itself seemed untouched (other than by dust)."
mostly harmless,3.0 out of 5 stars,Battery sucks,Verified Purchase,It's thinner than the s9. Big fn whoop.  The battery life is no better and that is what I really care about.  They could make the battery twice as big and the phone wouldn't be noticeably heavier.  So now I have to buy and lug a battery case just like i did with my s9.
ly12,5.0 out of 5 stars,Big Sized/Good Android Phone,Verified Purchase,"Phone works well! Phone arrived new and unlocked as advertised! Easy to switch SIM card from old Samsung phone to this new S20 FE 5G model! Love the screen size, east to read for ageing eyes! Phone functions as expected! Apps and data was transferred easily and automatically through ""smart switch""  Happy with purchase, would recommend!"
lorjof,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hello, hello, can you hear me?",Verified Purchase,"It is really quite simple.  After 4 months of using the phone, folks at the other side cannot hear me.  I looked up the problem online and found others with the same issue.  From the least destructive option to the most I went through the recommendations.  Ultimately I had to go nuclear back to factory reset.  That worked for about 6 weeks.  And it is happening again.  Run AWAY from this cell phone."
Techie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most important? This phone is exactly what is advertized.,Verified Purchase,"Just purchased this Samsung S-20 FE 5G and love it! The price compared to all the other S-20's ...well, I couldn't justify spending an additional hundred bucks for a slight upgrade.Kind regards,Techie"
Mary,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast phone with beautiful photos,Verified Purchase,"The phone is fast, perfectly sized, and works wonderfully. I like it much better than my iphone 11. I also have a Xiaomi and prefer this samsung. The camera has great zoom and can take beautiful pictures in low light. Definitely recommend this phone. Battery life is decent.Con:I am not a huge fan of the on-screen fingerprint sensor."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,worth buying......,Verified Purchase,"it is fast, smooth, good camera, the only thing that bothers me is the weight . it is little heavier than my old phone (note 5). One other thing if you watching videos on you tube and if you try to fill the screen at first you think it looks really great but if you play same video on the device than you know it cut out some portion of the video"
ARIEL RIBER,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected for the price paid.,Verified Purchase,This phone is listed for $600.00 or so and giving the brand I was sure jm getting a good phone .Mic is most my issue and so is the biometrics.Wouldn't buy again or recommend.
Elle BTop Contributor: Photography,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy with my S20,Verified Purchase,"I had a Galaxy S8 and this was so incredibly easy and quick to wirelessly transfer my contacts files and photos over to the S20 FE. No scratches or dents, brand new. Camera seems decent. So far so good."
Big D,2.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung Always Finds a Way to Ruin a Good Phone!,Verified Purchase,"Samsung seems to have a corporate mission statement and philosophy: if it works, update it and make sure it doesn't! Our first Samsung phones were great and now they are just another pain in the A.."
Fl cj,1.0 out of 5 stars,Scam--Refurbished,Verified Purchase,Getting someone else's order replies from Oral-B purchase on same day I activated the phone!
Nora,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had for 6 months, already not working.",Verified Purchase,The phone was great for the first 6 months but now it randomly won't charge saying it has moisture in the place where the charger connects.  It's not been near any moisture and a professional looked at it under a microscope and couldn't find anything wrong.  Really sucks because it cost a lot of money and it can't be returned.
Jeremy Cushman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great option that doesnât break the bank,Verified Purchase,"This phone is making me give up the flagship options. Affordable, great camera, decent battery life (and charges quickly, too), and has a great refresh rate (quicker than my iPhone 11 Pro)."
Tyler Giles,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,"Well this is a definitely a big upgrade from my lg g stylo 5. With plenty of space on the phone, faster ram and better battery life the phone is really great. And the camera is by far one of the best I've used in a long time. Well worth the money"
Ellie.L,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is NOT a brand new device,Verified Purchase,Deceptive description. This item came with a plain box looks like a refurbish item. This was not what was on the description of the item I bought. I intend to return this item but it says I cannot return this. I am extremely upset. Beware of this vendor
quasar21,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor software and battery life,Verified Purchase,"I wish Samsung had an easy way to get rid of the bloatware. I'm paying for the phone outright and I feel I'm being ripped off with horrible software. The battery is at 20 percent at the end of the day with moderate usage. Just beautiful and powerful hardware, botched by horrendous software. I wish I could just flash a clean AOSP rom on this, I'm going to try when some tools are available (if they are in the future). I would not mind paying 50 bucks more for the same phone running the pixel like Android."
Marcia Steele,5.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied,Verified Purchase,"Started using Samsung devices from the Galaxy S8+, coming from years of using Sony Ericsson/Sony.  I never switched back or changed brands because Samsung fully satisfied my mobile needs.  Satisfied so far again with this Galaxy S21 FE."
gamfem,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, water resistant also",Verified Purchase,"I bought this back in June 21.  It took me a while to adjust to converting from an iphone, but no problems getting around in the menus now.  The big plus is I dropped in my 8 ft deep pool today and everything still works properly"
Archie Cato,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome S20 FE 5G,Verified Purchase,Bought this as an upgrade to my daughter's old S7. Outstanding phone and for the price...you can't beat this. Unlocked and only needed to go to a local Sprint/T-Mobile shop to get a Sprint SIM card and worked flawlessly.  Highly recommended especially the color since the local  Sprint/T-Mobile stores do not even sell in this Lavender color.  A+++ Thank You.
Musicmom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Battery Life,Verified Purchase,"This phone will last all day and then some on battery. I always plug it in at night, but it still has lots of battery left. Sometimes it doesn't recognize my face and other times it does. Not sure what the difference is."
Long time Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G,Verified Purchase,"It is ""MADE IN VIETNAM"" and ""Box printed in Mexico"". Once I opened the box, first thing I draw my attention is the ""paper dust"" inside. I rechecked the box sealing, looks like it is well sealed, but dust come in from which step? How Samsung handles the product line?"
Joe C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well Pleased,Verified Purchase,Replaced a Motorola Android phone with this Galaxy S20 FE and can say that it far exceeds the quality of the Motorola. Don't let my lack of rating some of the options make you think that there is something wrong with them. I haven't fully gotten into those options so it would be unfair of me to rate them. I am well pleased with the function of the phone with everything that I have used. At a $599 price point this is a great phone that functions well without putting you in the poor house to buy it. I highly recommend it.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone m,Verified Purchase,Love my phone. Great pictures and long battery life. Didn't like that my charger is not 25W but a 15 so charging is not like 45 minutes to 1 hour instead of super fast charging capabilities. Has extra space for an SD card to increase your memory. 5G phone. Great for the price! FE doesn't have dual Sim so if you need that then buy the S20
Veronica Gutierrez,3.0 out of 5 stars,DIDN'T COME WITH THE HEADPHONES,Verified Purchase,"When I opened the box and checked every detail of the phone and the accesories, there weren't the headphones and that was dissapointed because I review the description and what comes with the purchase, the headphones were part of the deal and didn't come, just the pack that comes the headphones but empty. The rest is OK, the port of the headphones is different is type C, so I can't used by old samsung headphones in the new model."
T. Fackrell,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a new phone. Previously opened box, messed up inside.",Verified Purchase,"No receipt. Phone box had been previously opened the seal was broken the instruction papers all undone out of box. Fingerprints on phone where someone had taken cellophane off previously. Thought I was purchasing a new phone that I could get a manufactures warranty, but  you have to have a receipt and a new product."
Gary J. Kubis,3.0 out of 5 stars,Buy The  S21 Ultra 5 G Instead,Verified Purchase,Not ready for prime time yet. Has a lot of features but they don't work the way they should. Just traded it in for the S21 ulta 5g. This is the refined model. Works good.
Joseph T. Kelly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, reasonable price",Verified Purchase,"The phone is powerful and fast, the camera is very good. Using the Samsung app, transferring data from my old phone to the Galaxy was simple. The phone is slippery and you should order a case  when you purchase the phone."
Zongyi Zhou,4.0 out of 5 stars,A new phone with microSD,Verified Purchase,"In 2022 it's very difficult to buy a new phone with microSD support. I bought this S20 FE to replace my S9+. It was easy to transfer all my apps and data to the new phone.Unfortunately Samsung deliberately limits the performance of external SD cards to encourage people to buy phones with larger internal storage. My SDXC card can do 91MB/s read and 59MB/s write on my laptop's card reader, but only 74MB/s read and 38MB/s write on S20 FE."
Cynthia D,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fully unlocked just as advertised.,Verified Purchase,"I previously purchased the same Samsung phone listed as unlocked, but when it arrived it was not, thus phone was  returned.This phone however arrived new and unlocked as it was advertised and works like a charm, already had a SIM and just swapped it out and transferred data/contacts/pics, etc. in just minutes.  My first Samsung phone, wont be my last! No complaints with seller or phone."
RKHarm24,5.0 out of 5 stars,We have not used the biometrics yet,Verified Purchase,"We moved from a Samsung Galaxy S 5 to the S 20 FE. Major leap in upgrade technology.  Our 1st time buying an unlocked phone. Few hurdles for a couple of weeks. Now, still learning about all of the things I have NEVER heard of.Great Move on our part."
Jerry,4.0 out of 5 stars,A good all around phone for most people.,Verified Purchase,"It's a good all around phone. It has a lot of ""flagship"" features for a decent price. The in screen fingerprint reader is a little tricky to find until you get used to it. It has a good screen, cameras, processor, and battery. It's also nice to have a choice of six colors."
Robert,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good,Verified Purchase,It is a little taller than I would have liked. I used to have a s5 phone. Other than that so far so good. Battery seems to be lasting good. I think getting a case for it will help with the handling of the phone. A little slippery without one.
Neil A.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great price  Great features not so good battery.,Verified Purchase,I got everything from my old phone transferred over and set up and noticed the case was separated at one corner so set up return for replacement. Now I have the replacement and Good phone! Great price! Love all the features but the Battery not so good. I can't get more that 12 hours of not very heavy use before I have to charge again.
Osmin Castellanos,4.0 out of 5 stars,The best s20,Verified Purchase,"The battery, cameras, are great has all the functions of a flagship such as its older siblings the s20, the fluidity of the screen at 128 hertz is great, however with the latest update I noticed some lag when opening the camera app, I hope better with future updates, and if or if you need to use glass tempered because with the short time I have been using and emphasizing that I have taken care of it quite, however I already have several scratches and even on the glass part of the camera so if or if tempered glass for screen and camera module!"
Karl & Danielle,2.0 out of 5 stars,Missing Important Features,Verified Purchase,I am not sure if this is specific to my phone or not but I am missing wifi calling. I spent well over an hour chatting with samsung reps and could not resolve the issue. There is no setting to turn it on and it is not automatically turned on. They claim that their unlocked phones dont get it. I live in a place with poor cell signal so this is a HUGE problem for me. Also it wont even send texts unless you have at least LTE. I have had 2 bars and it wont send a text. Who would have thought than an S series phone would be missing such a critical feature.
Angela Mejia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely worth it,Verified Purchase,"I've had this phone for about a month now and let me tell you it's great, I love the camera quality and the battery life. Keep in mind that I use it heavily, sometimes I'm in ft for 9h and the phone keeps running perfectly fine while connected to the charger and it never overheats. I definitely recommend it, it's worth the price and more"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life can be improved,Verified Purchase,Great phone for loyal Samsung Galaxy users but other flagship phones around the same price range have better features. I owned an S8 for years and noticed this phone did not improve battery life as much as it should after 4 generations. But still great overall phone for standard users like me.
bt23,4.0 out of 5 stars,Please improve the battery life,Verified Purchase,"I love having the galaxy s20 fe, such a huge upgrade from my s8. The battery life is my only complaint. I've had it for 4 months now, and I can tell it's already not holding its battery life long. That makes it really frustrating sometimes. Other than that I love it."
Matt R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this phone so much, I traded it in for an S21+.",Verified Purchase,"This was my first recent Android phone. I had used iPhones for years, after retiring my old Galaxy S5 years ago.I was absolutely blown away. For the price, this is an absolutely amazing phone. It's still a full-blown flagship, just with a plastic back and minus a camera. Huge battery. Maybe closer to the S20+ than the regular S20.I loved it so much, I decided to trade it in for a Galaxy S21+. But if you're not a tech snob like me, the S20 FE is a flagship without the extra flair."
Susan Patterson,1.0 out of 5 stars,What a piece of junk,Verified Purchase,Screen touch ridiculous.  I try Swype or direct touch in messenger or Google search and it skips and is intelligible..  Takes forever to charge . Had Samsungs forever and this is a piece of crap.
Subhankar Baidya,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent phone. Nice camera.,Verified Purchase,"I have been using it for a couple of month. I am not a gamer and I just use the phone for daily calling and sometimes for video conferencing. Haven't experienced any lag for the normal phone usage yet. Since I am not a heavy user, battery stays charged for more than a day. Nice screen resolution. Camera is pretty good too."
Rebel,1.0 out of 5 stars,Canât make phone call after 3 days,Verified Purchase,"Everything was great until the third day when I couldnât make any phone calls. I could hear people on the phone, but they could not hear me talk. They wanted me to factory reset the phone every time this happened which was three times in one day."
Troy Boone,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for mom,Verified Purchase,"After my mom was nagging me for a new phone (Motorola doesn't really hold up IMO), I bought her this one on the payment plan.  So far she seems to love it, and I do notice the faster screen refresh compared to my S10e (Comparable to my Note I gave away). Its too big IMO but she loves it so I love it"
MikeyrInJeff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wife loves her new phone,Verified Purchase,"Bought this phone for my wonderful wife. She absolutely loves it. It's a very pretty device. Not much more I can say about it because I don't use it. I can tell you that I'm waiting for the S 21s to take hold so I can afford to buy a new S 20 Ultra. See you in the funny papers, lol"
Julie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fingerprint reader works flawlessly.  Fast phone,Verified Purchase,"Much faster than my Google Pixel 3.  Worked like a charm right out of the box.  Easy SIM card swap.  I need to get used to the controls, as I have had Google phones for years.  Fingerprint reader is perfect.  Set it up to read your thumbprint . That way you can do everything with only one hand."
Laura o,2.0 out of 5 stars,It's regular,Verified Purchase,The phone is good but before the month the charging system was damaged and instead of changing the entire phone... they changed only the charging system... I think if something is not working well. They should exchange it for a new one
LSK,1.0 out of 5 stars,Zero Stars,Verified Purchase,Doesn't work properly. Phone blacks out and Amazon would not accept a return because return window recently closed. EF Amazon and the horrible supervisor that took this call.
Sirrena,1.0 out of 5 stars,Shuts off,Verified Purchase,Within the first 5 hours it shut off multiple times and the screen kept freezing. Ended up returning the phone. Your best bet is to go straight to your phone provider.
Christine,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone,Verified Purchase,Good 5G phone for the price. Heavier than expected...got a Otter cover and screen protector. Camera didn't work at first but Amazon Customer Service helped get it working.
Madison,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase!,Verified Purchase,This is my first Samsung as I have only had LG in the past. I am an android plan and have used iPhone but not owned. Setup took awhile but that may have been user not the device itself. Many features including ones I have not tried yet. Takes great pictures for a phone which is what I was looking for. Very satisfied his first month of use. Used with tracking. Slim design and large screen but not too large for my smaller hands. Love it so far.
ted,1.0 out of 5 stars,Screen Out after 2 months,Verified Purchase,"The sceen went out exactly 2 months after it was delivered. I've tried rebooting it, that does not work. This is terrible."
MARDI,1.0 out of 5 stars,S20 FE 5G HAS NO HEADPHONE JACK!!!,Verified Purchase,I ordered this S20 FE 5G not seeing the fine print which stated all S20 models came with headphones (and a headphone jack) Except for the S20 FE.  When the phone arrived I sent it back unopened.
JR,1.0 out of 5 stars,SIM 2 slot non-functional,Verified Purchase,"Samsung and the US corporate overlords (Verizon, AT&T, T-mobile, etc) have chosen to prevent us from using this phoneâs second SIM card slot. Evilâ¦ DONâT BE EVIL!"
ArconReef,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good value but fragile display,Verified Purchase,"Definitely use a proper case with this phone. The screen shattered the very first time I dropped it. the front panel uses an older, cheaper, less crack resistant gorilla glass than the flagship models have. Even with a solid case the screen may still shatter if you are a klutz who drops their phone frequently. The battery life is enough to last most people a day to a day and a half. The fingerprint reader is slower and less reliable than either of my previous two phones (S9+ and OnePlus 7T), but it does work. The 120hz display is great!"
Jeff Petrilli,1.0 out of 5 stars,Battery Life is Deadly!,Verified Purchase,Battery life is sub par for this expensive phone. Chatted with Amazon rep and did nothing to help me. I hate to return it and go through the process again. I hate when things are junk.
DJ Philter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Android!,Verified Purchase,I bought this to upgrade my slowish Samsung A50. The Samsung S20 is really fast and I have been using it for about a month now and it is still very fast!
CBalseiro,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good purchase,Verified Purchase,"The phone is totally unlocked and works with gsm card of differents counries(USA and Argentina, for instance). Also  works great  and the cameras are excelents, also the screen is crystal clear. I think this phone is a bang for the buck! The transition from from my old S9 was without any glitch."
Leslie Gibson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"its super fast, works great",Verified Purchase,"The fingerprint recognition is great, facial recognition is lighting fast. The batter lasts all day and then some. When on the internet there is no lag with surfing and / or watching netflix on the device.  I use the hotspot alot and no issues there. I would buy again."
Erik,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked for Two Weeks before Screen got messed up,Verified Purchase,"Bought this phone to replace my Galaxy S9. It was great for two weeks, but suddenly the screen started acting like a magnet stuck to a CRT television. Resetting the phone did not help and shutting it down and turning it back on only works for a few minutes before it returns to the glitchy screen. I plan on getting a replacement, but I can't rate it higher than two stars at the moment. I probably got a bad phone but I didn't drop it and it is in a very heavy duty case so I don't know what happened to cause this."
Diana,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice phone,Verified Purchase,"My second Samsung, I found it pretty easy to use. Battery life seems good... A full day for me. Fingerprint reader works fine.  Wish I could easily color code calendar items, but it seems that I can't.  Nice phone tho.  Like it a lot."
David Kjell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Grand Phone, Great price",Verified Purchase,"Haven't had a Samsung since my old S6.  Was buying cheapies for a few years and it just has not been worth it. Ever so glad to back with Samsung because quality is indeed the less expensive way to go.  Do yourself a favour and DuckDuckGo ""Boots theory of wealth"" to see what I mean.Sure the S20 FE 5G is not fully an S20 or S20+, but it is a very nice device"
Deanna Seeger,1.0 out of 5 stars,Money back,Verified Purchase,Not working money back
Jerry Pasadena,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than LG,Verified Purchase,I came back to Samsung after couple of years with LG and so far I am happy. The battery life and cameras are terrific. Everything else works great as well.
debi,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's a phone,Verified Purchase,I needed a phone and this one was a decent price. It's a lot like my other Samsung but it still has a lot for me to learn. Battery lasts longer than my old one. It's bigger than I wanted but I can deal with it.
Alexander Ortega,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent cell phone, good price",Verified Purchase,"My wife is very happy with her new Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G.  Great photos, lots of space, excellent quality at an affordable price.  The speakers are very strong, I suggest to lower it a little before your phone rings."
Priyank Jitendra Ajmera,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Phone and a total value for money.,Verified Purchase,"I got this on Prime Day sale for half the price and frankly it was a steal deal.This phone is so good, its as good as a flagship phone.

Rye Guy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone. Colors are off.,Verified Purchase,"I ordered the Cloud Orange, as Orange is my favorite colour. Problem is, it's not even orange. It's a peach color. So I'm returning it and getting the Mint Green instead. Otherwise, phone is responsive and works great. Good Photos as well. Happy with it."
calliecat,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use of the camera.,Verified Purchase,"Love the color, bought a clear case so I can see it. So far I'm happy with the phone and camera. There should be directions for using the camera instead of going to YouTube."
Chicago,2.0 out of 5 stars,Way to much bloat wear,Verified Purchase,"Android phones use to be easy to use and navigate, this has way to much samsung proprietary software that is not at all intuitive.  No back button, u have to swipe.  Complicated for no reason."
Mrs. LG,2.0 out of 5 stars,Camera not good .,Verified Purchase,"If your looking for a phone with a great camera,,,THIS AIN'T IT.Go for a Samsung 10 .Otherwise it's your basic cell phone ."
Diana Denney,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE my new phone,Verified Purchase,I really like the S20 FE phone. I upgraded from a much older phone. It was a much needed upgrade. Everything runs much smoother. Battery life is better. Storage space is better. Camera is awesome! I LOVE it!
AMC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to Set Up & Use,Verified Purchase,Another great android phone.  Purchased during prime day - def worth the money.  (previous phone was 5+ years old).  Love that it doesn't come loaded with a bunch of service providers apps that are uncessary.
Efrain Flores Figue,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty amazing device,Verified Purchase,"I was replacing a Redmi K20 Pro after it started showing problems with the display. I was certainly amazed with the features on the device as well as its performance. I loved the utility to transfer the information from the old phone to this one. The battery life is great. When the time comes to replace it, I'll probably go with another Samsung."
jayson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best phone around this price range,Verified Purchase,"After I had my pixel 3axl for a year, I decided to get this samsung phone. This is easily without a doubt the best phone I owned. All specs are good and screen is a fluid and smooth display which I like. Borderline a really good phone. It feels premium (it basically is) but of course the higher end phones will have better specs and better looking screens. But this is probably the best phone on the market for this prices range. I recommend this phone  it's been treating me well for the past 2 weeks and hopefully it will last me long"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,packaging is horrible,Verified Purchase,"Seriously, shipping a $600 item in a cardbox box 3 times larger than original box, with little filler.The original box shifts and rattles within the shipping box. Remains to be seen if the product itself  is  undamagedThis is on you Amazon, nothing to do with the manufacturer"
Mags Dad,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice upgrade from prior generation,Verified Purchase,Nice upgrade from prior generation Galaxy.Pleasantly surprised by battery life.Sound and camera both excellent.

Adrian e.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible battery life.,Verified Purchase,This phone does everything I need it to do and it does is well. The only problem I have is the back of the phone can pick up fingerprints really easy. But other than that its perfect. The battery life is also amazing I can go through the whole day using it at max performance and I still have battery left over.
Nematjon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung s20 fe,Verified Purchase,It is simply great!!!
Elaine W.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Too early to tell,Verified Purchase,"I 've been trying to resolve problems (i.e. still can't access my voice mail) with Verizon, my server..  It has been a nightmare and under terrible conditions since I,ve been experiencing medical problems at the same time and I was unable to to receive important calls that went  directly into my voice mail.Could this possibly be a malfunction with the phone?"
Escorpiona,4.0 out of 5 stars,In veraizon it works,Verified Purchase,The cell phone is very nice I put 4 stars because it is not very strong in vibrating mode
Not to happy,1.0 out of 5 stars,not worth the money,Verified Purchase,no one could hear me talk when making phone callstook forever to load anythinghad to press whatever button you were wanting multiple times for it to finally take and then start to load.
Mike,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good and stable phone.,Verified Purchase,Did a lot of research. This phone proves to be capable and at a reasonable price for a workhorse phone these days. Phones can be expensive we all know. Arrived fast and in good condition. Great purchase.
Tshepang Mogaila,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Value,Verified Purchase,"Initial thoughts on battery life were not so good, so I moved from 120Hz screen refresh rate to 60Hz and got an instant boost.However, later I moved back to 120Hz, because I paid for that feature, and to my surprise, the battery life was better. This must have been due to optimizations and the device learning how I use it.Overall, great, versatile triple camera, smooth 120Hz display and awesome software."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase!,Verified Purchase,"I have nothing but great things to say about my new phone! It's beautiful, the screen is amazing and bright, and it does everything I need and more. Highly recommend if your looking for a mod priced phone. Love Samsung!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better of what i expected,Verified Purchase,"Very good value for the money, flagship specs but for a lower price. The only thing that cut me off guard was the color of the phone, i bought mint cloud but i looks like a pail blue kinda a71 baby blue. But other wise good phone."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Phone was fine but had to return because wasn't unlocked,Verified Purchase,Phone didn't work with my wireless company.Put back in box shipped back in perfect condition and Amazon charged me a $110 restocking fee .Be careful ordering from Amazon .It's a shame such a big company steals from customers
MeMe,1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT A NEW PHONE,Verified Purchase,This phone was locked tied to another # and still owed payments on it. The Verizon Store said it was probably stolen.So disappointed! Not buying phones here again!
Michael L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone!,Verified Purchase,Great phone so far. So easy to set up and transfer all my info from my S9 and did it all wirelessly. Paired up everything for Bluetooth as well. Not glitchy and colors on screen are so clear and bright. The price was definitely right and I would absolutely recommend it to everyone!
Mayra AT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy,Verified Purchase,"I was nervous because it was the first time I bought a cel by this means. Luckily it went well, I'm happy with my cell phone, I have more than a week using it, so far everything is excellent."

Steve Bradford,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Get one,  NOW!!!",Verified Purchase,Amazing Samsung phone. More features than they advertised. Samsung gave up the house in this phone. The Camera is beyond bad a**.
P. McConnell,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good battery life.,Verified Purchase,This phone is not as user-friendly as my LG was.  Still working on finding all the settings that I am used to having and also trying to eliminate the ones I don't need or want.  Best thing about this phone is the longer battery life.
blueroom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product at a reduced price.,Verified Purchase,"I loved my previous Galaxy S8, but since the battery can't be replaced, multiple charges were necessary every day. The FE S20 is blazingly faster, and 1 charge is good for 24 hours plus. A best buy rating from Consumer Reports sealed it."
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best phone I've had in a while.,Verified Purchase,It's unlocked so any carrier can be used with it and the camera is one of my favorite default apps to use simply because it's so crisp and clear. Even at 30x zoom it's still clear enough to read small signs about 10 cars away
Rod,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Prime Deal,Verified Purchase,"This was a great upgrade for me. I got the 128gb with SD card slot and I am in California and it's hooked up with t-mobile no issues. All in all we'll worth the purchase for the moment, but will keep my eyes open on the s21 fe should it be similar."
Isabelle Pollacco,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast. Works well. Battery lasts all day. Beautiful resolution. Camera zoom is awesome. Great phone!,Verified Purchase,Have not set up face resolution. Fingerprint set up before putting Screensaver and might slow down the recognition.
Mercedes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stylish,Verified Purchase,Viewing videos on the large sceeen is wonderful and the video quality is exceptional. The camera is amazing. Thisphone is just the right size for one-handed manipulation and pack with features.
rose,1.0 out of 5 stars,My new Samsung S 20 makes me sound garbled when I call out.,Verified Purchase,I am very disappointed that I received a new S 20 galaxy that was defective.  My husband told me that I sound  garble when I called him.  I was sure it was his phone not mine as mine was brand new.  After a few weeks of people stating they had trouble hearing me I realized it was my new S 20.  I just want it replace.  Not have it  repaired.  It was defective so just replace it.  I was defective from day one do the right thing and replace it.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy,Verified Purchase,"Bought as gift, so far so good"

Dena R.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed.,Verified Purchase,"The battery life on this phone is absolutely terrible. It goes from 100% down to 80% within 2 hours. Just regular use, just texting and looking at emails."
Laura Morris,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good and Bad both,Verified Purchase,The storage is good and it has alot of good features but the battery could be alot better. I love the fingerprint reader but if you use wifi or Bluetooth for anything the phone will die in just a few hrs.
pierre,3.0 out of 5 stars,No dual SIM,Verified Purchase,"This US version has room for two nano SIMs but only #1 will work.Maybe you can have a nano SIM + a e-SIM, but I didn't try.If you want true dual SIM, buy the european version.Comes with 2 IMEI nunbers on the box, actually works with 2 SIMs"

One who reads,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very nice phone with an awesome camera.,Verified Purchase,I love some of the features and some I don't.  But the phone so far has worked well. Having trouble finding otterbox defender case for it. The battery life is better than any other phone I have had.
KNEADaTENSION,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than new,Verified Purchase,product arrived quickly... works fine... no noticeable blemishes or defects... MUCH less expensive than new
Jill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Upgrade from S8,Verified Purchase,The display is wonderful. Very smooth and vivid colors. I upgraded from an S8 and the phone is much more powerful. The transition was also seamless. The bigger screen/keyboard is taking some getting used to but it is a major upgrade. The camera is incredible as well with many more features than my previous phone's.
Tammy Wiegel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery does not stay charged long like it was advertised to.,Verified Purchase,I like the phone itself but the battery does not last very long when it's 100% and I'm not using it it will be down to like 92% when I go to use my phone and then it drops quickly when you make a phone call so I'm really disappointed with the battery.
cali,5.0 out of 5 stars,Price and quality,Verified Purchase,I'm very pleased with this phone.  I looks brand spanking new and works flawless. One of the best purchases thus far
Andy Barillas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing item!,Verified Purchase,"With the idea that I thought/expected this item to be less better than it actually is, it surprised more than what I thought, it came with a charger, it's headphones as well as every thing necessary for its function plus, it was actually unlocked unlike the first phone I bought, it is nice and amazing if I was able to buy another I would exactly right here."

Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung S21 FE 5G,Verified Purchase,"Phone works well, but your first month will be spent on the internet trying to find hidden setup options."
Kayla Ruelas,5.0 out of 5 stars,SO WORTH IT,Verified Purchase,Before this phone I had a rinky dink free phone that was slow and laggy. I bought this and it was such a major upgrade. I use cricket cause I'm both Mexican and broke n I was able to use my old Sim card (I wasn't sure the phone would be compatible tbh). The phone came with everything it said it would come with and so far no problems whatsoever.
DeusExKing,4.0 out of 5 stars,Phone is good.  Fingerprint reader not so good.,Verified Purchase,Took over a dozen attempts to store fingerprint.  Finally got it to store one but it rarely works.  End up  using the pin. The rest of the phone is great.  The s21 is much better.
Julie O,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT PHONE,Verified Purchase,"I've always had an android phone!!!  Love this one.  Great features, long ladting battery, takes great photos & easy to operate!!!"
Azumah Bacchus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a dual sim phone ,disappointed",Verified Purchase,"No it did not , it was  advertised as a dual sim phone but operates as asingle sim phone as the phone can only recognize one sim in the slot thatwas made to hold two , there is no sim card manager option in the settings,other than that, it is a very good phone with excellent performance andfeatures,  I have to now find cash to  source another phone to house myother sim card ."
Cece,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome phone,Verified Purchase,"Absolutely loved the phone. I've been using it for about 1-2 months and it is still such a perfect phone. The camera is good but it doesn't zoom when you turn it to the front, but it's completely fine because it zooms a lot when you turn the camera to the rear. The battery life lasts me a long time, I'd say 2 days if you're using the phone.  Fingerprint reader reads my fingerprints really well. Everything is working right!"
charchar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,Verified Purchase,So far it's a pretty cool phone. Really fast processor.  Picks up 5G when it's around.  Like that it has expandable storage. Fits well in my pocket even with the silicone case.Wish I could have different notification sounds not just one sound for everything.
F-Bomb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone,Verified Purchase,"Pretty good phone, I like the fingerprint reader. A good upgrade from my J8, but the battery life could be better."

David R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive phone for a great price!,Verified Purchase,"I would recommend to anyone to buy this phone I come from iPhone XS and I donât regret at all switching, the S20 FE has so many cool features that youâll love, also for the price you get high end phone specs, this must be the best 2020 phone!"
Reid H Davis,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cloud Red? Not Red,Verified Purchase,"Man, like the phone but ""cloud red"" equals PINK. Not happy with the color or the representation of the color on the website. Hate that I purchased a clear case for it. I guess I just live with it for 2 years. Probably buy another case."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone so far.,Verified Purchase,"This phone is amazing compared to my galaxy s7 edge. The battery life is excellent, the first day I had the phone I was messing around with it all day and it only went down about 35%. I've had no problems with the fingerprint scanner or facial recognition.The front camera or selfie camera is a little grainy but the back camera is badass. All in all very pleased so far."
Christian,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this phone!,Verified Purchase,"Great, powerful phone with fantastic features and case color is beautiful! Very happy with this! Touchscreen sensitivity is a little off, when using a screen protector though, even with sensitivity settings activated."

Your Friend,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone,Verified Purchase,"I replaced my Galaxy J7 with this phone and the upgrade was huge! It runs so much faster and smoother, and I can actually take decent pictures now. All I had to do was move the T-Mobile chip over from my old phone. Well worth the purchase."
Mitch,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its a pretty good one. No problems!,Verified Purchase,This has actually been a really great phone for the price. It does everything you want it to do if you just hang around tik tok and take alot of pics.
George Ortiz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad Battery,Verified Purchase,The battery has lost 22% power in less than 2 hours with during set up.. My  3-years old phone lost 5% in the same time.  I will see how it looks by morning time. I might hav e to send to back for an exchange.

ravi rampersad,3.0 out of 5 stars,Phone didn't come with a charger.,Verified Purchase,For a refurbished phone it was not cleaned properly; around the back camera and the scratches at the back were more than noticeable. If I knew better I would have paid the extra for a brand new phone. I do hope it will give me battery life and a good 2 or more years of use. Further to this I will be giving it a month of use and if any glitches would for sure contact Amazon and the seller
Cwright,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most beautiful phone ever!,Verified Purchase,Gorgeous Color so glad I went with Cloud Orange its like a orange/pink color. Amazing camera too!

Andrea Gonzalez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good Flagship Phone at Half the Price,Verified Purchase,"So far so good, unboxing, this phone definitely felt like the higher end flagships. Sturdy, a bit thicker with some weight to it. Screen is flawless so far, very reactive, and the colors are vibrant. It is an unlocked phone for GSM and adapted to the SIM card very quickly. Switching from Galaxy to Galaxy is also very easy with Smart Switch. I believe it was a good buy considering the A line of Galaxies are hot on it's heels with a similar price"
Zachary Boyd,5.0 out of 5 stars,Flagship phone with a mid-range price.,Verified Purchase,"This phone is THE phone people should buy if they're trying to get the best bang for their buck. You're essentially getting flagship specs in a phone that is 200-300 dollars cheaper than the more expensive flagship. If you're looking for a phone right now, you should really consider this one."
SassyLou,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice phone at a good sale price!,Verified Purchase,"Easy to set up and works with Verizon.Love it!I'm glad I got it on sale, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten it."

James DeBois,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything as Advertised,Verified Purchase,"The product was rated by PC Mag as the best 5g for the money. It's a great phone, a little taller than my old ASUS that died. Amazon delivered this phone within 3 hours of my ordering it along with the case I ordered. It's too big for my wife but I just ordered her the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G, can't wait to see it. I am very impressed with Samsung..."

This phone is advertised with Dual Sim but it does not allow it and it does not say anywhere in the publication. This is something that should be clarified. Still the phone is very good, despite everything."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,"Overall happy with the phone. Few little quirks, camera wants to go to portrait mode instead of landscape when trying to deposit checks. Battery is good, not great.For the price it's a solid choice"

Randy Paris,4.0 out of 5 stars,Watch if you change the color of the phone,Verified Purchase,"I bought the s21fe g5 and liked it so much, I ordered a second one for my wife.

Romeo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,"Best phone I've ever owned.

Zed V. Steuer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone upgrade!,Verified Purchase,"Upgraded to S20 FE from a Moto G 3rd Gen and wow was i behind on technology. The reason why I upgraded because the Moto G only had a 4gb internal storage and couldn't get apps on the 32gb microSD, so my apps were limited. I really love this phone and I'm sure I'll have it for years to come."
Kalindu_P,3.0 out of 5 stars,NOT for dual-sim,Verified Purchase,"Good phone, but do NOT buy if you're expecting this to be dual-sim: Samsung bricks up the 2nd sim slot in the US so only one sim can be used with this phone."

Jonathon R Denton,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth upgrade outside major city,Verified Purchase,"Dislike the fact that despite being newer and having w better battery, this underperforms compared to the note 9. Firmware issues causinf rapid battery drain and wifi connectivity issues... returning phone as it overheats to the point of scalding the user."
Imran Lourenco,3.0 out of 5 stars,The dual SIM function does not work,Verified Purchase,"The dual SIM function doesn't work. The software doesn't allow it, so having the dual SIM capacity on the phone is pointless.Otherwise the phone is a very nice built phone."

The phone works great.

arman,1.0 out of 5 stars,Inaccurate product detail,Verified Purchase,The phone was in new condition and works great but the description says it's unlocked and the one I received only works on Tmobile.

R,2.0 out of 5 stars,Do not recommend,Verified Purchase,"Honestly, I've never had a new phone act up this much after just a couple of months. It's constantly freezing and the system itself keeps ""not responding."" I should have spent the extra $200 for the regular S20."

I highly recommend this device, it also has certain features the s21 doesn't have, for a cheaper price."
Adonis Goris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone,Verified Purchase,The phone is like new even though I buy it as used but the only complaint I have is the box and the phone was full of hair. Like that was weird
Laurel Bryant ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Only supports the first level of 5G.,Verified Purchase,The Verizon educated me on this phone.  Said it did not support the two faster levels of 5G.  Had to send it back.
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,,Verified Purchase,
Daniel Matianski,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fast refund,Verified Purchase,"This was my first large online purchase.  Always worried about how hard it may be if something was wrong.  Sure enough my phone had a small crack when it arrived.  Got in touch with Amazon.  They sent return labels to me and as soon they received the item, I received a full refund.  Got another phone and it's great.  I will shop with confidence now."
Sarah,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pictures and camera features , nice size  , Sensitive touch screen",Verified Purchase,excellent photos and the single take feature that selects photos from videos is great . the touch screen is sensitive and makes random selections if scrolling . comfortable size .
jesse,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very glitchy,Verified Purchase,It has a mind of its own. It glitches on from sleep mode and turns the screen face on and off repeatedly over and over and over. Nothing makes it stop until it stops on its own. Super irritating.
Angelica Daleiden,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does NOT support boost,Verified Purchase,"I feel pretty lied to since it said it was unlocked to all carries, but when I put my virgin mobile/boost disk into it, it said it wasn't supported so it doesn't support everyone."
Mary L,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing to compare it with.,Verified Purchase,The lack of clear instructions for a newbie.  All the apps and ads put on in factory.  I paid enough for the phone to not have the irritation of trying to disable them all.  Weeks later and I still do not know most of what the phone does.  Other than that it is a necessary evil.  This is my first smart phone.
hp,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the one to get!,Verified Purchase,Worth the money! Superb performance. The high refresh rate really gives a smooth feeling. The audio and video are great too. The fingerprint reader is not so fast and doesn't work sometimes when it gets a little wet but not like it is inconvenient!
Makesha,3.0 out of 5 stars,Midrange,Verified Purchase,"It's OK, feels pretty midrange though, might as well get the Samsung A51 or A71. Battery drains a lot faster than on my iphone 11. You can get a full day if usage isn't heavy. Performance is really good, but other things like camera, screen speakers, etc...now a total wow."
Moe,1.0 out of 5 stars,it was missing items and the battery doesn't hold charge,Verified Purchase,it was missing items and the battery doesn't hold charge

AZZMAN20,1.0 out of 5 stars,Was is supposed to be used?,Verified Purchase,I was expecting a brand new phone. I got an obvious used one. Box was missing pieces and there was grass under the screen.
Grace Elligott,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor durability,Verified Purchase,My husband had his old Samsung Phone for five years no cracks or scratches in the glass. Two days with this one and the screen is shattered from one two foot drop. Definitely buy a case this one has zero durability.

R.R.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone battery is disappointing,Verified Purchase,Great phone over all. I'm a bit disappointed at the battery life though. With light use the battery wouldn't last two days without recharging. Which honestly isn't  terrible. But for a brand new phone I would have expected better and it's obvious not going to improve over time. Do love the camera!
Hershel G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works and looks like a new phone.,Verified Purchase,It works and looks like a new phone.

Mark Poullos,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a decent phone, but a little large.",Verified Purchase,"Fingerprint scanner works, but only when I get my thumb just right, and it wasn't picking up any better in the training session. Methods to open menus or swipe away windows tend to overlap in applications and for the phone notifications...etc. resulting in a lot of wrong windows opened or swiped away."
Eduardo Rojas,4.0 out of 5 stars,S21 FE,Verified Purchase,"an upgrade from my faithful S10e. A bit bigger but no so much heavier.works fast, good camera and great screen. I think the battery life could be improved, is not as long lasting as I expected.But great features for a good price."

Dee,1.0 out of 5 stars,Moves off of the screen you are using to a different screen by itself.  Very disappointed,Verified Purchase,Battery does not last a full day. Less than 12 hours. When using an app the phone will close and move to a different app by itself. GPS navigation beginning to give problems of shutting down begore reaching your destination.  Not pleased with this phone.
john j ferrese,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent phone,Verified Purchase,"great phone , does everything you need from a cell phone"
SheepKid12,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's a phone. What else do you really need to know?,Verified Purchase,"Basically the title (but I will add this: I would recommend watching some tech reviewers and get their opinion before making a purchase). I'm docking one point for a weird bug that forced me to reset my phone (Android had failed to boot, then came back glitching with apps not working and whatever. It was weird, and i don't fully understand what caused it to happen)."
Lakhvinder Singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst product ever,Verified Purchase,If I can give this product is zero review I I would but I canât I just canât explain how bad of a quality this product is just donât get it please itâs not worth the money donât waste your money

Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone!,Verified Purchase,Pretty great phone. Camera quality is nice and although the fingerprint reader works 80% of the time its not a big enough deal to bring it down. Battery life lasts pretty long depending on what youre watching or doing. Charging takes awhile but if you turn on the fast charge its not so bad.
johnnyflammable,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product!,Verified Purchase,i got the white color and bought the black case for it; also the glass screen protector for the front and the rear cameras.i see people complaing about the mistake that it was posted about being 8gb of ram.im just happy that i got it for 100$ off: thank God!thanks!

2kold,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's an OK phone,Verified Purchase,"The phone isn't that bad, however I'm not giving it 5 stars because of 2 main reasons. 1) The battery life isn't as good as some people would claim in my opinion. And 2) every since it receive an software update, part of my screen would just stop working every so often and my home button also won't work for a period of time."

ChifanTop Contributor: Photography,4.0 out of 5 stars,Some pros & cons when upgrading from S9 to S20 FE,Verified Purchase,"I took advantage of the T-mobile trade-in program to upgrade my aging early 2018 Samsung S9 64GB to this new late 2020 Samsung S20 FE 128GB which allowed me to get this phone for $200 + taxes. Overall, it's a very good phone for the price even without trade-in, but there are some pros & cons which I'm going to lay out below.*** Pros:- Price / Affordability. Obviously this is the biggest pro of the S20 FE as you can upgrade to one of the newest phones from samsung for not too much without having to shell 1000 dollars or more.- The S20 FE has 6GB of RAM which is an upgrade over the S9's 4GB of RAM. Although looking at my Android's settings Device Care info, I seem to see a larger RAM usage for the S20 FE (around 3.4GB usage without any apps open which leaves about 2.6GB available when idle, versus around 2GB of available space when idle for the S9. So you gain a little but not as much as expected. This may be due to the new upgraded Snapdragon 865 processor being more memory hungry than the outdated processor on the S9.- The S20 FE has 128GB of onboard drive space which is twice as much as the S9. So this is def a big plus. Also you can add up to 1TB of SDXC memory.- The Cameras are much better on the S20 FE than my old S9, no doubt. You benefit from the 3 camera setup with good performing lenses on the 0.5x, 1x and 3x lenses. As a professional in the photo/video business, it's very welcome and you will be happy with the S20 FE's camera performance overall. The selfie camera also is a big improvement over the S9.- The Fingerprint sensor placement is much better at the front of the handset below the display. A big improvement over the S9 which was at the back of the phone.*** Tie- In terms of overall performance and daily usage, I would say you get about the same performance as the S9. You won't notice that the S20 FE is snappier or slower than the S9 for most apps used. Browsing feels about the same, even though the S20 FE touts the 120Hz display, but has a lower pixel density in terms of screen resolution. Colorwise, they are about the same in terms of vivid colors or contrast/brightness.- In terms of battery life, I see to get about the same performance as my S9, even though the S20 FE touts a larger battery, but also has a bigger display so it evens out.- In terms of 5G performance, I tested it in a few places and I don't see much improvements in terms of Upload or Download performance over 4G LTE. It's very uneven depending on where you are. On T-mobile, I get about 40Mb/s to 90Mb/s downlink with 5G vs 50Mb/s to 75Mb/s with 4G downlink. and around 25Mb/s uplink for 5G and 4G similarly when I'm in a good area. So I decided to just switch back from 5G to 4G LTE settings on my android phone, so meh... as far as 5G is concerned... maybe this will improve over time.*** Cons:- My biggest con is the S20 FE definitely feels heavier and is much larger to hold than the S9. It is about the size of the S20+ and I wished they kept the width of the S9/S10/S20 so that one-handed usage is much easier. With a protective case added to the S20 FE, you will be hard pressed to use this phone one-handed unless you have big hands. I don't unfortunately. After all, they called it the S20 Fan Edition, so why make it so much larger? Samsung could have made the S20 FE taller but kept the S20 width... Food for thought for later iterations! Please keep this in mind Samsung. Not everyone wants a larger screen at the cost of having to use 2 hands all the time.- As others have said, why did they put the volume buttons on the right hand side? Why not keep these buttons on the left hand side? Probably because it's a two-handed device, so they thought, might as well have everything on one side so you operate it with your thumb... Poor design/UX in my opinion.- Loss of the 3.5mm phone jack. Alas this is becoming standard on most higher end phones from Samsung/Google/Apple... Sad... Now you have to use a dongle and can't charge & listen to music with a wired headset at the same time unless you buy another heavier dongle with those 2 ports (USB-C & 3.5mm) which may or may not work seamlessly... I decided to buy the Samsung 3.5mm to USB-C dongle because there doesn't seem to be a dual port dongle that works perfectly yet. And I don't like using bluetooth all the time with a wireless headset.- It's still early for the release of this phone, so you won't get many good covers & screen protectors alas... I bought a clear cover from T-mobile TO-GO branded, and so far it is just too bulky & uncomfortable of a cover and way more expensive than on Amazon. But the covers on amazon are not yet shipping... Something to bear in mind as you will pay 2x or 3x more via T-mobile to get those accessories right away.- One last small pet peeve, is the loss of the kind of clean wallpapers I had with the S9, now you get those flowery preloaded wallpapers that are just not UI friendly, they are too bright and busy so your icons & Time/Date don't separate nicely from the wallpaper background... You gotta download themes/wallpapers from the Samsung Store to get some equivalent ones... but not exactly the same as S9 which were so nice.So in Summary, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G offers a nice cost effective way to upgrade your aging android phone that's say 2-years old or more... like it did for me with my former S9. You gain in RAM, drive space, and a larger display, but you lose in terms of one-handed usage and a heavier phone to hold, carry around, and larger to slip in your pockets, and no more 3.5mm headphone jack... sigh. There isn't much improvement in terms of performance, operability, or battery life over the S9, but at least you know that this S20 FE is close to being the latest and greatest from Samsung  for the next couple years until you upgrade again to another iteration... For me, it's a 4/5 star phone and is worth the upgrade from the S9 still but I'm missing my S9 already because it was so good at doing most everything with just one hand... now I gotta use 2 hands with this phone most of the time... but at least I have enough onboard fast memory space with 128GB which will allow me to add more apps/take more photos/videos when the apps need the speed of onboard memory to take the photo shot."
Nghia D. Tran,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a great flat screen galaxy phone,Verified Purchase,"Pros:1.  FLAT SCREEN.  Thank God now i can get a cheap tempered glass protector and not have accidental edge touches. Works great.2.  120hz screen. Full HD+ is perfect for this size and the 120hz does make a difference scrolling through websites and images.3. Micro SD card Expandable storage, wireless charging, on screen fingerprint scanner, fast charging.4.  Huge 4500mah battery lasts two days for heavy users.5. Triple camera setup. The 3x optical zoom on the telephoto is nice.6. Nice feeling plastic back i like better than glass. No cracking.7. Water resistance.8. Great lower price!Cons:1. 6gb RAM is more than enough for my use case even when i play games but 8gb would've been nice to have.2. 3x optical zoom camera is nice but also maybe a bump up to 12mp or 16mp and a bigger aperture would be an improvement.Best Samsung Galaxy phone in the last 5 years!!  Stick with flat screen and lower prices Samsung!"
Danny S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great with a few flaws,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to love this phone. It's flat display with a highend chipset and good cameras is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately it has a few small flaws that will have me returning it.1. 6gb of ram, not the end of the world. But, it does hold back the 865 from performing as well as it can. Again not a huge deal, but I felt I should mention it.2. Too dim of a screen, this is the killer for me. No matter if on automatic brightness or not. The maximum screen brightness is too dim for me in outdoor scenarios and the screen washes out too easily. This is the reason I feel like I have to return this phone.Too be fair, if you don't need or use your phone in outdoor lighting, this thing is great otherwise."
Fox Cockerell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just when I was out, Samsung pulls me right back in.",Verified Purchase,"Around 2 years ago, I ditched my iPhone 8 Plus for a Samsung Galaxy S10e. All at once, I was frustrated with what I was missing sticking with Apple. Why should I continue to pay more for $800+ phoned without OLED screens, with only one camera, and with needlessly restrictive software, when things on the Android side of the smartphone game are better than ever? I switched and never looked back.As my time with the S10e wore on, I was troubled by the direction Samsung seemed to be taking. Their prices were going up, and their technology was not advancing at the rate I had once found wonder in. The S20 starting at $999 was just icing on the cake of fear; had Samsung led us all on? What phone was next for me when my S10e finally gave up the ghost? I pushed away OnePlus, Google, and other midrange phone manufacturers for months; until the announcement came.I picked up my S20 FE 5G on launch day, and have been blown away by it every second of ownership. For a $700 dollar phone, it blows all preconceived notions of ""midrange"" out of the water. For starters, the screen is absurd. An HDR10+, 120 Hz, Super AMOLED of this size? Are you kidding? It's amazing. And the 4500 mAh battery has no issues driving it; I've gone a couple of days between charges by this point. The cameras are absurd too, especially the 32 MP selfie camera; the sharpness is honestly too much sometimes.Also, the plastic back is nothing to worry about in the slightest. Not only is it actually aesthetically pleasing, but it's solid and easy to grip. I have no qualms there. The phone as a whole is lightning-fast in kind. As a Verizon user, my 5G experience is very limited, so I can't attest to it's usefulness in this review; but I'm sure it's fine!My only qualm with this phone would have to be the bloatware; we should be done with all these Zynga apps being preinstalled. However, it takes 10 minutes or so to uninstall them. I can't knock it because of this.Let me be clear; this phone is the way to go. We are at an amazing point for smartphones; why not really care about something you use most of the day? We go to work on our phones, we attend class on our phones, and we consume most, if not all, of our entertainment on our phones; go with something that works for you. This phone does for me to an almost fervent degree."

",VINE VOICE,Excellent phone donât pay attention a bad reviews,Verified Purchase,I am notice all the bad reviews about this phone come from peoples who canât even know how use a phone . Donât pay attention if you want a real reviews look from professional tech . I am in shock how people complain about a cord or memory card slot in this time any high end device come like this also headphone jack is completely removed from any big manufacturer brand. If you want a good screen camera and performance buy this phone in my opinion is best value compared to the new galaxy s22 .
LC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't get much better than this!,Verified Purchase,"I currently have a Galaxy Note 10 and before that the Pixel 3.  The Note 20 has been great but I've been wanting to upgrade to something with a better battery.  I've tried the Note 20 Ultra (too big and bulky) and the Note 20 (not worth $999 or even $799) and finally arrived at the S20 FE.  So far, the battery life has been great with 6-7 hours screen on time.Compared to the Note line and pretty much everything else in the marketplace right now, this is a fantastic device at this price point.  The screen is as good as the Note 20 line with its great color accuracy, sharpness and bright screen.  While it doesn't have WQHD+ like the Note 20 Ultra, it does have 120hz which the Note 20 doesn't.  So if you're running 120hz, you can't use WQHD+ anyway.This device also has a fantastic camera system that takes better shots than the Note 20.  I've compared them side by side and the S20 FE delivers more vibrant and sharper images.  While the telephoto is only 8MP, it didn't seem to effect the quality and outputs pictures that were just as good as the Note 20.  The Note 20 Ultra has an amazing telephoto, so if that's important to you, then go for it, but costing about $500 more than this device, seems not worth it.If you're a Pixel user, One UI is an adjustment but I actually enjoy it with all the options it brings. Unlike past Samsung devices, their OS doesn't slow things down in the least and this phone is as fast as the Note 20's that I also tried out.  Samsung has also been great about doing monthly updates and will be giving 3 years OS support on the S20 FEI do wish it came with 8GB instead of 6 but I haven't noticed any performance issues as a result - the device feels just as fast and fluid as the other more expensive phones I tried with much more RAM.  Perhaps if you're a gamer or heavy multi-tasker, this might be a bigger factor to consider in your decision to buy this device.I've seen comments about the finger print scanner being unreliable but I haven't experienced that at all.  In fact, it's been much more reliable and way faster than sonic ones in the newer Note 20 devices I tried.If you're considering this over the Pixel 5, the S20 FE seems the better value with better CPU, 120hz screen and more versatile camera system (but the Pixel will undoubtedly take better pictures as its the camera king!), expandable storage, bigger battery and faster charging.If you're considering this over the Note 20 (standard not Ultra), the S20 FE is a much better value for less money giving you 120hz screen, expandable storage and better camera.  Unfortunately you lose out on the S-Pen with the S20 FE, but if you can go without, then the S20 FE is a much bigger bang for your buck.At the end of the day, I think this phone is a superb value at $599 and the best you can get at this price point."
dave,5.0 out of 5 stars,unsettling,Verified Purchase,"Enjoy the always-on OLED with punch hole.  Just peek at the phone and you know the time & notifications.  Always-on is the best feature.  Perfectly happy with the styling and performance.  Wish the battery could be user accessible-but that is a personal opinion.I was prepared to purchase a 25W charger, but after experiencing the bundled 15W, I sense that 5V 3A is nice balance between faster and cooler operation that will probably prolong the working life of the battery.  Similarly for the Qi wireless charging which is naturally inefficient and runs even hotter.  I am shopping for aftermarket chargers, but no hurry.The set of bundled apps is unsettling and in need of attention.  A first clue was when ""calendar"" did not sync properly.  Turns out that Samsung has an entire set of unbranded applications spoofing basic Google apps including:  phone, calendar, contacts, my files, clock, gallery, messages, and more.  What is unsettling is that these Samsung apps are UNBRANDED presumably to lull consumers into believing they are Google branded apps.  It seems this required many gatekeeper failures including but not limited to:  Google App certification approved a set of  ""unbranded"" apps to exist.  The trickery continues with unbranded notifications with no explicit indication which app is requesting access to personal information.  For example, is enabling ""Find My Phone"" a prompt from Samsung, Google, the data provider, and/or some other entity?  There are also unbranded notifications that appear from hidden Apps that are not readily located such as ""Carrier Hub"".  [Try to find that in my apps.]  The many overlapping and redundant requests for permissions to parse messages, mail, files, locations, settings, behavior, calls, logs, sounds, videos,  swipes and keystrokes because concerningly invasive when the asking party is anonymous.  Some permissions such as Bixby cannot be changed.  Another sloppy mistake was a terms and conditions click to agree screen that was missing the actual terms and conditions statements.  Surely the EU, California CCPA, and other laws prohibit such deception.The out of the box experience can be daunting.  Many steps and ""insider knowledge"" are required just to turn on and configure the phone.  Setup can be never-ending.  Each time you want to turn on the phone:  you have to pick up the phone, tap twice, wait for facial recognition to fail, swipe up, enter password, swipe up to get to a home button, hit home, then navigate to where you want to be.  Shipping an obsolete version of Android is disappointing and let's just say there is some opportunity for software updates to improve.A minor tip:  The sim tool is hidden in a secret compartment of the retail box.  For my experience, the retail box is tight fitting.  After removing the top cover, it is very easy to miss a secret compartment stuck inside the top cover containing the pin used to pop open the sim slot.  There was a white piece of blank paper that made it appear to have a false top.  The useless instructions also happen to be in that compartment."
Lindsey,2.0 out of 5 stars,"An expensive, so, so phone",Verified Purchase,"On paper the phone looks great. But coming from an S9, I wish I would not have purchased the S20FE. The virtual proximity sensor is awful. 8 times out of 10, it will inactivate the phone if it's against your ear. But 2/10 times it will not and if you are moving around while on the phone, you will dial other people, hang up, put the call on hold - you name it. The LED notifications are gone and replaced with on screen notifications. First thing I noticed was the charging screen notification, nothing will burn in a screen like repetitive text. The fingerprint scanner is worse than prior versions - again the S9, was far more advanced. The Gorilla glass 3 will be less impact resistant than the 5 used on other phones. The glass has an odd cheap feel, like I have plastic on it, but I don't. The camera produces ok shots, but all need some touchups when I get home. Either over exposed or too much contrast... Selphies are also pretty bad, the fixed focus just doesn't do a good job. Then there are the screen problems. I haven't quite figured this out, but I get ghost touches and ignored touches. Playing with the sensitivity does not resolve the issue.  If you, like me spend a lot of time on the phone, you better get a headset, as using this phone, as a phone will result in hangups and all sorts of issues because of the crappy proximity sensor.I tested the Wifi compared to my wife's S9 and the S9 would consistently get > 120Mbs, the S20FE was averaging just over 100Mbs. Used the same SSID and was in the exact location. So the S20FE loses the battle against the S9 in terms of screen quality and scratch resistance, fingerprint scanning, proximity sensor, typing accuracy and wifi speed. Pretty bad that a 2 year old phone is better than a brand new one."
Bugatti314,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overall good phone for the price but has some issues.,Verified Purchase,"I switched from Motorola to Samsung after my Z3 started dying after mere months of use. There is no way I will ever pay a thousand dollars for a phone that will be obsolete within 2-3 years. That's just not going to happen. The S20FE seemed to have 90 percent of the features of the S20 at a reasonable price so I got it. It's definitely better in most ways than the Motorola and I'm happy with it so far.One thing to be aware of as soon as you power up is that stupid 120 Hz setting - turn it OFF immediately unless you want your battery dying in a couple of hours. It's really useless for most tasks and it's activated by default, which is why everyone is complaining about poor battery life. At 60 Hz my battery easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use.I got the 128 Gb version with 6 Gb ram from my Verizon store since I already had an account and they gave additional discounts for immediate activation. I then added my 128 Gb micro sd card so I should finally have enough storage and app space to breathe for awhile. The phone will accept up to 1 Tb cards.Screen brightness is disappointing. It's only half as bright as my $49 Samsung J3 I use to fly my drones. In fact it's only about the same brightness as my old Motorola. Not good in sunlight. Not happy about this at all. The little J3 will sear your eyes in daylight with boost mode! WTF? Why?!Another major flaw is the absurdly slippery case, which constantly tries to squirt out of my pocket or hands every time I touch it. I dropped it three times while waiting for my Spigen Rugged Armor case to arrive. All those nice colors this phone comes in are pointless since you are absolutely going to drop this phone at some point without a good case to cover all the slippery surfaces. Not MIGHT drop it - you WILL drop it. It's that hard to hold onto. I also contrasted this with my trusty J3. Again, the FE loses, since the J3 has an absolutely perfect tactile surface that was designed to be held, not dropped. The J3 surface is so perfectly designed I didn't want to cover it with a case - and I have NEVER dropped it! Again I have to ask - W.T.F.??? was Samsung thinking when they designed this S20FE phone?So the camera is very good for a phone camera. In fact it's better than some of my actual cameras. I experimented with photo, video, single take, slo-mo, and was very impressed with the quality I get without much effort. The 3x optical zoom I really like. It also digitally zooms to 30x in photo and 12x in video mode. I handheld full zoom with image stabilization and got surprisingly sharp results. I really like this camera. I use  Lapse It Pro when I want to take high quality time lapses so I didn't spend much time with the built in version but it seemed to do ok. There are very few adjustments on those modes.Bluetooth connects very well to my speakers at high quality. Also to my fitness band. Wifi is decent as well. Where this phone is a notch above my old Motorolas is in signal sensitivity. It picks up cellular signals in places my Droids were just dead. Like in an industrial building basement with lots of concrete and steel. I still had a data connection (slow) and could text.Headphones are questionable at the moment. My USB-c adapter doesn't work with this phone. I get an error saying it's not supported. Nothing at all about wired headphones in the manual. So I ordered Bluetooth buds (NOT Galaxy - since they pulled this cheap stunt I will not reward them) I ordered the TOZO T10 and will update when  I test them.Phone call quality is solidly above average but not great. Another feature that is actually better on my bottom of the line J3 phone!Overall, this phone is a good upper mid level option for those tired of the cheap $150 phones and don't want to spend a fortune on the latest gadget."
Doughmay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung Galaxy S20 FE â 18 Months Later,Verified Purchase,"The S20FE, redefined what it meant to be a budget flagship, and a premium mid-range device. Still, nearly 2 years later the value is still ever present. The device has been my daily driver since October of 2020, and this is my take on the handset. Keep in mind, this device launched at $700, I only paid 450$ with device trade in. Letâs go over the basic specs:- Snapdragon 865 CPU- 6GB RAM/128GB ROM or 8GB RAM/256GB ROM- Wifi 6- 5G- 6.5 inch AMOLED display- Under-Display fingerprint sensor- 4500 MAH battery- Gorilla Glass 3 on the front display.Pros:- All-Day battery life. As the strange advertisements suggested this device can get me through a day of moderate to heavy usage. My usage time is upwards of 8 hours on some days. It doesnât perform as well as when I first got it but it does still last all day, easily.- Display. The AMOLED display is sharp, crisp, and extra smooth with 120Hz mode enabled. It is great for content consumption.- Software. One UI on top of Android is not for everyone. Samsung has a distinct flavor that isnât stock. But, Goodlock from Samsung puts the power in my hands to change most things like colors, icons, etc. The customization is crucial for me so I donât mind One UIâs more questionable styling choice because of its flexibility. Plus, 4 years of software updates is always something to appreciate from an android handset. Google is the next closest competitor to this standard.- Rear Camera. The back 3 cameras have been everyday champions at capturing the moments that I want to share with my friends and family. The newest iPhoneâs will certainly beat this device especially in night photography, but overall its pictures are sharp, colorful (maybe a bit saturated), and high quality. Video too has been great and the camera app has useful tools to make pictures and videos even more special.Cons:- Gorilla Glass 3. Being a daily driver, this device has been everywhere with me. My last device, the galaxy s8 had Gorilla Glass 5. I am not super clumsy, but I have been known to drop my phone occasionally. I had been lucky for the first 12 months to not have any cracks, but my screen did get a crack across the middle after a 4ft drop from my waist as I was putting things into my car. So, keep a screen protector on this device if you are prone to the occasional drop or two. Gorilla Glass 3 is super scratch resistant, but it couldnât stand the drop.- Size. This one is super dependent on who you are as a person and how your hands are. I have hands that are on the smaller side. The galaxy s8 was the perfect size. Coming to this phone which was taller and wider proved at first to be a bit of a challenge. I canât stress just how large this phone is compared to a standard iPhone. The device was comfortable to hold but my small hands would sometimes drown in the sheer size of it all. But, This is entirely like, a me problem haha.- Front Camera/Facial Recognition: the front camera is a little disappointing. For me, I hated the small metal rim on the display. It ruined the bezel-less clean look for me sometimes. But, especially with facial recognition. It isnât any kind of fancy 3D scanning IR like apple uses, its just 2D facial scanning. Which isnât great. You can register a face, but it isnât reliable in any sense and it just doesnât hold the bar.Odds and Ends:- Touch Sensitivity: When the device first came out in 2020 there were reports of touch sensitivity problems and instances of ghost touches. My device had this issue at first but then a software update and calibration did fix my issue of touch sensitivity. I havenât had any issues since. But on release, it was a bit rough. I think though, the software update fixed this issue for most individuals- Under-Display Fingerprint Sensor: This device comes with an optical fingerprint sensor under the display which is kind of futuristic. But it can be hit or miss. For me, after a few software updates it is almost always pretty solid and consistent. There are times when my finger is on the display at a weird angle, and it wonât unlock but it is fast and mostly reliable. It is not as fast as rear-mounted scanners like on the Galaxy S8 and S9 series. But it has gotten better since release. Now, it should be a pretty okay experience to use.Overall, this device has been an amazing value for me over these past 18 months. It has gotten 2 software updates so far, and they still have 2 more to receive. The device should get up to android 14 according to Samsungâs 4 years of support. So, it still has lots of life left in it, and anyone considering this in 2022 should still buy this device. It is not the newest device, but it is solid in terms of its performance and value."
Wayland,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone for the price,Verified Purchase,"For $600, I would say this is a pretty good phone for the price. I have had mine for a week now and am pretty satisfied. Coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy Note 8, this is a good upgrade. You can check out the specs on any Samsung's page, so I'm just going to list my personal pros and cons. Most of my cons are relatively minor when taking into account the phone is $600 new.Pros:Price - $600 new is a great price. The only other phone I was considering was the Google Pixel 5, which is $100 more.Battery life - The S20 FE lasts a full day easily even with 120hz turned on. Coming from a phone with a 3-year old battery that was struggling to make it the full day, this is a big plus for me.Back cameras - The back cameras are a big upgrade from my previous Note 8. The Note 8 was fine if there was enough light, but as soon as things got darker, photos went downhill. The photos I have taken so far on the S20 FE look great.120hz - Scrolling and animations are very smooth. I don't play any games on my phone other than Genshin Impact or TFT once in a while, so this was a nice plus rather than a must have for me.MicroSD card slot - I store all my photos on my SD card, so the S20 FE having a slot for that is nice.Flat screen - As someone who quickly got annoyed with the curved edges on my old Note 8 rendering it unusable without a case, the S20 FE's flat screen is a nice change.AOD - The always-on display was one of my favorite features of my Note 8 so glad to see it's still around.Size - I love big phones, and I love big screens even more. The 6.5-inch display is great, and the phone is about the same size as my Note 8, which has a smaller display. I have long fingers, so I don't have much issue using the phone.Cons:No headphone jack - By far my biggest complaint with the S20 FE is the lack of a headphone jack. I don't see why it's necessary to exclude the jack on Samsung's newer phones. Seems like a ploy to get consumers to buy their overpriced wireless earbuds. I had to buy some dongles on Amazon so I could use my existing headphones.Front camera quality - While the back cameras are impressive, the front camera is less so. The selfies I took with my girlfriend were kind of washed out and overly smooth. The 32mp photos don't look any better than the 8mp ones from my Note 8.Touchscreen issues - I have had touchscreen issues where instead of scrolling the screen will randomly register it as clicks instead. Most noticeable on Instragram where it'll click on random profiles instead of scrolling. So far, it looks like restarting the phone fixes these issues for a few days. Hopefully Samsung fixes this with a software update.Buttons - I am fine with Samsung moving the volume buttons to the right side. However, Samsung should have considered adding additional buttons to the left because now there isn't anything there. A do-not-disturb slider or a dedicated camera button would have been nice.Overall, I would recommend this phone for anyone upgrading. For $600, you get a great phone.Edit - July 2021 Update:Been using the same phone still since September of 2020. I saw this phone was on sale for $479 a couple weeks ago for Amazon's Prime Day. This phone is a no brainer at that price. The touchscreen issues were all resolved with a few software updates late last year. I have not encountered any touchscreen issues since then and don't have any further complaints in the past year. Battery life still lasts a full work day from 7am to midnight with around 25-30% battery life left."
Julia,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So-so responsive screen, but overall a good phone",Verified Purchase,"Coming from Pixel 3a, S20 FE does feel like an upgrade. It's not mind-blowing, but I can see myself using this phone for quite some time before the next flagship. One big reason for the upgrade was 5G. To be honest, I can't quite tell the difference between 5G vs 4G LTE that I've been using... Still, I don't regret my purchase and going to keep using S20 FE.Pros:+ Look of the back: I really like the orange color and the matted texture. I really do. It just fits me.+ 120 Hz screen speed: it makes for a smoother scrolling when I'm reading the news or e-mail. However, it does eat up battery life+ Camera zoom: The range is 0.5x - 30x, which is more than what was possible in 3a.+ 128GB internal storage: plenty for me, a regular phone user to take pics and videos. There's an option to use a microSD, too, for additional storage.*Side bar: this is a useful feature of Samsung phones. A shortcut. Makes it easier to keep my screen looking clean and organized.*Spotify 6-mo Premium: I bought the phone from Samsung directly and it came with Spotify for 6 months.*Samsung Smart Switch App: made it easy to port data from 3a to FE.*Water-resistant: for Pacific Northwest, this is a must...So-so:*Camera:  The camera features other bells and whistles like slow mo, hyperlapse, super slow-mo, and even food mode for social media. The camera is catered to social media for sure. FE has night vision, but tbh, 3a had better night vision mode. It's not the worst, but it's not the best.* Battery life: 3a had better battery, but play with the power mode, this phone can last a while. With heavy use, this phone will die on you fast on High Performance or Optimized. Can last you a day under medium power or light use. I had this phone go without a charge on a weekend camping trip, and was able to make it last by placing it on maximum power saving. Based on usage, the battery can last, just not past a day...*Screen (videos and pictures): it looks great. Colors do look a bit saturated when I took pictures with it. There are options to change to a more natural look, but default is the saturated look. Youtube, Netflix... Streaming is fine.Cons:* Bloatware and features: Coming from Google Pixel 3a, this phone comes with a lot of features right off the bat. Samsung proprietary apps do feel like bloatware, but not all of them are throwaways. Few are useful.* Screen (responsiveness): it falls short. Randomly, the screen becomes unresponsive to where my finger is. That makes it hard to unlock my phone. The phone becomes frustrating at random times because I can't unlock the phone or open an app.*Updates: no Android 11 yet...*Size:  ... it's big. It feels more like a tablet than a phone in my hands after a while. There is a one-handed mode, but ... the physical size is still big. At least, with such a mode, I don't have to stretch my thumb or fingers for too long. It's annoying though.Despite the shortcomings, for some reason, FE fits and gels with my needs for a phone. I can see myself using for 3 - 5 years. Even with S21 coming out, I think I'll stick with FE for a while until the next upgrade."
Beth Durham,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mediocre Phone,Verified Purchase,"I am offering this review after owning the Galaxy S10E for about 1 year.I got this phone after I dropped my Moto X in water and I chose the Galaxy because I have a Galaxy watch and they two are supposed to work best together.I don't particularly have any complaints about the phone, it makes and receives calls. Runs the Android Apps that I find essential.  It has reasonable storage.The Moto X have functions to turn on the flashlight (shake the phone) and camera (twist the phone) that I still miss  In fact, when I DO need the flashlight, I find it very cumbersome to turn on as it is a button on the pull-down settings menu.THe Galaxy has a power share function so I should be able to charge my Galaxy watch from the phone.  This does work, however, you have to lay the watch on the BACK of the phone - perfectly centered and STILL.  I've had the phone in an Otterbox case the whole time I've had it and when I did need this powershare function, I had to take the phone out of the case.  The screen got scratched all to pieces the one time I tried to do this - when I went on a short trip and forgot my watch charger.  So, I wouldn't recommend using that function unless you can closely control the environment and ensure the phone doesn't get bumped and is laying on a soft and very clean surface.It is a small phone - I don't have complaints about the screen per se, but when I hold it out of the case I feel like it might slip through my hands easily.I have dropped it a number of times - in that Otterbox case - and it has never cracked or failed in any way.I've mentioned the case a couple of times so I do want to make a disclaimer - I won't buy another Otter Box case - it is supposed to have a lifetime warranty and the corner of it is broken off...I did say that I've dropped the phone, but that corner fell off at the strangest time - in fact, I got into my car and there was a piece of blue plastic lying on my black seat after looking all around, I realized it had come off my phone case. When I contacted the manufacturer they asked me to pay them $6 or $8 to ship a new one.  That doesn't seem like much of a warranty to me.Regarding the interaction with the Galaxy watch:  The Wear app doesn't do much.  It will help you find the watch if it's lost in the house. Mostly it offers you about a million different watch faces - there's a whole section of the app dedicated to the watch face.  As far as functionality, it's very hard to find apps for the watch thru that app."
J_M_,1.0 out of 5 stars,Returning this to Samsung,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this unlocked directly from Samsung.I had this phone for about a week and the transfer and setup process using the Samsung Switch app was so bad that most of my apps didn't get downloaded. Instead there is an app icon that launches a web browser. Seriously Samsung, this is pretty basic stuff.The software also doesn't transfer account information and app specific settings unless you're transferring from another Samsung device. Not a good strategy to get customers from other manufacturers to switch to their products.The fingerprint reader is terrible and it sometimes it takes 5 - 6 tries to get it to work.Pictures are blurry.Lots of Samsung bloatware loaded on the phone constantly asking you to login to your Samsung account.Sending this back to Samsung and will be looking at other phones. Maybe a OnePlus 8T which is comparable, but comes with more storage and memory - 256Gb and 12Gb RAM."
S. Nasar,1.0 out of 5 stars,a lot of problems.,Verified Purchase,"This phone achieves two really good goals, it's an amazing phone and really good value for money. You get a lot of great features and specs that are usually found in more expensive phones for the budget price. It's fast, very smooth and responsive, great camera. The plastic back might not impress some but for me it's VERY acceptable sacrifice for the lower price, I use case anyway and it's better than having glass. You just can't get a better phone for this price.UPDATE: well, things went south fast. This phone seemed great first couple of weeks but then it started showing problems. The brightness ALWAYS acting up, even after disabling adaptive brightness, when I am in direct sunlight outside it DIMS and I can barely see. The phone freezes and gotten very slow. Also every software update seems to make it worse, mostly recent update (3/26/2021) caused several apps like weather app to glitch. It's just so much trouble. I have only had this phone for few months and I already want to switch back to Google pixel."
Karen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone for the price,Verified Purchase,"Love the phone ,Not crazy about the buttons on one side because of the screen  shot process,  will get use to it.I used the S20 FE all day, more than usual, to see how the battery  life was and to me it was great.  I upgraded from the Galaxy S9 because I was tired of constantly charging it.Do wish Samsung would  give the ok to have Otterbox and other companies have cases available when the phone is ordered.Well worth the money, did not want to spend  a fortune for the S20."
DaytonaDan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best big phone value out there,Verified Purchase,"If you want a big phone with state of the art features, the S20FE really has no competition.  It does pretty much everything the more expensive S20 phones do at a much much lower price point. And if you have a decent phone to trade in (go the Samsung site for more details), it is practically a a steal. I traded S10e and got this one for $285.  Hard to beat.There are few minor difference from the more expensive siblings, like a glass vs plastic back and a 10X vs 3X optical zoom. The screen res is bit lower on the FE but you would be hard pressed to notice the difference. It is great screen. Oh, and no millimeter 5G, just the low end version of 5G,  which is all that exists now anyway in 95 percent of the US. And a lot of places don't even have that yet.If you can live with those minor shortcomings, this is the phone for you. Also be aware this phone is actually bigger than the S20 and almost as big as the plus.The super fast 120 refresh rate is a big selling point. Something almost no other phone, beyond the S20 lineup, has.  Makes scrolling super smooth and fast. Stereo speakers sound better than most phones. Wifi 6 support. In screen finger printer reader works well.  But also has face recognition unlock. Infinitely customizable, as most of Samsung's high end phones are.There are only a few downsides. It comes with a low end, regular than fast charger.  But if you have an older Samsung phone with fast charger, it  will work here.  Some idiot decided to do away with a simple power button. You have to press volume AND the Bixby button to turn if on or off. Insane.  You can change that in the settings and make the Bixby button the power button (which should have been the default).  Bixby (digital assistant) is a major pain in the butt, but you can drive a stake through its heart and get rid of it completely  with some effort.  Google it.  Many different settings must be changed.Overall, this is the best phone for the money I have seen in a long time.  Don't bother with anything else if you want a state of the art phone."
edward drolet,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not factory unlocked,Verified Purchase,"AVOID THIS SELLER: TOTAL SCAM!!WISH I COULD GIVE 0 STAR REVIEW!!Have had nothing but issues trying to connect to a network. I have at&t, the phone won't allow me to make calls, can only use this phone with wifi access. It's essentially a small tablet right now. Even though I have at&t, the phone still says ""Sprint"" in the upper left corner. I'm trying to work with Amazon to return this phone currently. I'll update this review when I get a response.UPDATENo word from Amazon or this Seller still. This phone is absolutely useless. Sprint doesn't even exist anymore. I could not be more disappointed or furious. May as well have burned the $700 dollars."
Two Pants Sky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its nice,Verified Purchase,"I was skeptical about buying this phone since I was always a huawei/apple user. I got tired of apple because of the storage and my huawei phone no longer supports google due to the ban so I figured I picked up this phone despite the reviews. It is really nice. The fingerprint works well and the battery life and touch screen is nice. The screen is moderately big and it includes a microSD card for additional storage. Camera quality is decent. Its better than the iphone, but not better than the huawei one. The volume is 10x better than my iphone. Overall, for the fan edition its nice and at a decent price. It has everything a s20 has so I cant complain."
Bjorn D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Coming from Iphone 11,Verified Purchase,"It feels like a generation has passed compared to the iPhone 11. First thing I liked best is the zoom lens that zooms in 3x and does not loose a bit focus or clarity. Plus the screen is AMAZING. LED 120hz it is very smooth and fast. The downside is the OS. APPLE has android beat hands down for OS smoothness, screen sensitivity (I am often cought touching the sides of the phone screen and clicking when I wasn't trying too on samsung.) Being 23 years old I can learn to navigate android but APPLE IS BETTER FOR 40+ years old! Next year will be switching to iphone 13 but battery life is good OS just needs simplification."
Arturo,2.0 out of 5 stars,This phone is not for the busy professional,Verified Purchase,"When you look at texts you have to push another prompt to be able to call the individual who texted you. Why not just push phone?  Maybe not a big if you have time but if you need to make 3/4 calls in 5 10 minutes it is. The playback button is right next to the call back. If your in a hurry and busy that causes issues because, and maybe it's just me but sometimes I push the call back and have to hang up or talk to someone when I'm pinched for time. Another issue, that I had with my S10 when you push phone massages I keep getting texts massages. WTH! Only way I can get to my phone message is by restart which is more time intensive than the S10.The people who designed this have no idea how busy a professional can be between clients, customers. If you have lots of free time and patience and are very tech savvy this might be the phone for you."
X. Chen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone at a great price.,Verified Purchase,"Update#2: The reason you want to buy the Fan Edition of Samsung Galaxy phones is because you can use the Samsung DEX app. If you don't use the app than any android phone will work fine. But with the Samsung DEX app it makes all the difference. only the S phones are supported on the DEX app. Although the A series supports Windows Link. It's garbage compare to the DEX app.Update: been using it daily for 3 months now. All the accessories for this phone is cheaper than the rest of the S20 lineup except the battery. The battery for this month is 3~5X more than other Samsung phones. Makes it expensive to repair, like if Samsung doesn't want you to replace it.So far I thought the FE 5G is a pretty good phone.You get the camera app of the s20 ultra.Pro camera settings you can only find on high end cameras.Dolby Atoms audio.Micro SD memory slot.  yep it's a option that's missing on the S21s.Some minor issues.Bluetooth audio device missing battery % indicators."
Guangming,1.0 out of 5 stars,Think twice before decision,Verified Purchase,"I have had four Samsung smart phones. One bought from carrier, others bought from Samsung. The first one is Galaxy A, about ten months later, the inner speaker doesnât work, have to use out speaker to pick up calls. But the carrier replaced it for me quickly. The second one is S9, about 13 months, it canât charge by cable, because out of the warranty, I have to buy a wireless charger to use it. The third one is S9+, about 15months, the fingerprint reader doesnât work properly, I have to use pin or face ID to unlock the phone every time to use it. The fourth one is Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G, about 10 months, the WiFi cannot turn on. I went to a repair spot authorized by Samsung two times in a month, then they said they canât fix it, need change the mainboard, no values for repairing. I have to contact Samsung. Guess what they said? They refused to replace it and told me I have to mail in the phone to Samsung then they will decide what they can do. That means in about one month, I will have no phone to use. For saving your time and money, think twice."
Tucsonian,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this phone, with one exception",Verified Purchase,"I really like this phone. It has great clarity, speed and good quality cameras. The only thing I don't like is that it does not have an LED notification of emails, texts or calls.  I know this is a bit trivial, but it is something I really miss and wish this new F20 fe 5g had. I've seen some apps that provide this notification, but they require very intrusive information gathering requirements, which I don't want either.....  The trusted places feature on my old s6 rarely worked, and the same holds true on this new s20 fe, it rarely unlocks my phone automatically when I'm at my trusted place. On the plus side, the fingerprint feature never worked on my old s6, it seems to work about 95% of the time on the s20 fe.  I have not tried the face recognition feature as of yet, so I can't comment on how well that works or doesn't. The battery life seems to be about 50% better then my old s6. I'm not a constant user of the phone like some are, so I can go two and half days between charges.  This is a really nice phone and I'm glad I upgraded from my old s6, but I can't understand why they gave up the LED notification feature."
John S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Buttons Fall Off, Samsung Customer Support Unhelpful",Verified Purchase,"I purchased this phone from Amazon in November 2020.  In most ways it's an excellent product.However after 6 months of routine use the POWER button fell out of the phone.  I searched online and discovered this was a common problem, but I imagined it would be a simple repair  I brought the phone to a Samsung Authorized Service Center which told me that:1) Loss of the POWER button was considered âcosmeticâ damage by Samsung and would not be covered under the 1 year warranty2) The POWER button is integrated with the display and cannot be replaced independently.  So in order to fix the button I would have to pay for a new screen.I phoned Samsung customer service and they repeated the same explanation, but offered that I had the option of bringing the phone to a Samsung owned service center (a 90 minute drive each way) where they would inspect the phone and if the loss of the button was deemed a manufacturing problem then the replacement would be free.  Otherwise I would have face the same charge for screen replacement and I would have wasted half a day getting there and back.It's extremely disappointing that the only frequently used moving parts on this otherwise fine product are engineered with such flimsy plastic.It's extremely disappointing that Samsung does not accept any responsibility for the design problem.Any customers who buy the phone based on its otherwise good performance and value should exercise great care when pressing the POWER and VOLUME buttons to avoid unwelcome repair expense."
Robert,1.0 out of 5 stars,One of the worst phones Samsung has put in the market,Verified Purchase,"I've had the Samsung 20FE for about 5 months. Had to replace my Galaxy s10 plus. What an absolute downgrade. The phone is buggy, has screen and charging issues. Constant bluetooth issues. Horrible audio feedback via bluetooth echo and static on calls. The phones hardware is a step down from all its borthers and sisters meaning this is the ""ugly stepchild"" from Samsung. Save your money, this phone will cause more stress and headaches worth than the extra 300 you saved from its better brother. My provider will not accept a return even thought ive been a customer for 20 years. Worst Samsung phone ive ever owned."
Schwartzy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Phone is dead after a light fall. Why?,Verified Purchase,"I had my unlocked phone for 5 days--bought directly from Samsung. I had it in light bumper case, with reinforced corners. Clearly it was not enough.I was in a forested park today when I dropped it on soft ground. The back lower right corner hit a stone. It is cosmetically perfect, but it will no longer turn on.  I've tried multiple ways to reset and charge, but it is dead. I've had 4 Samsung  phones before. But I've Never ""bricked"" one.I was disappointed in the case maker and the phone maker. I do not have a protection plan, but I feel like this is a failure of the maker of this supposedly shock resistant phone. I will contact Samsung, but I thought I should leave this as a warning.It is a nice phone, but get a thick case, people."
Nony,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stay Away!,Verified Purchase,"Had it since middle of Oct. 2020. MY GRIPES: (1) As usual, I have tried 3 times to dictate this and I watch it flashing, then it stops and types NOTHING. (2) It FREEZES all the time, no matter what app I am in. (3). When I dictate period at the end of a sentence or comma somewhere, it spells it out. (4) I had to turn off Auto Captitalize because it was capitalizing 3 or 4 words in the middle of every sentence. (5) It repeats text! Once it repeated 3 lines of text 15 times. (6) The cursor is not stationary. It jumps up and types in the middle of a prior sentence. Or if editing somewhere, the cursor jumps down and starts typing in the middle of another sentence. (7) I have problems with the simple task of copying and pasting! Won't work sometimes unless I type 1 letter 1st, then the Copy option will appear. And, in reverse, many times I get no Paste option unless I type in 1 letter 1st. (8) It is always inserting multiple words I didn't even say that I have to erase.  (9) WORST, is their Contacts app. Yellow head,  white shoulders and an orange background. I just noticed it a week or so ago. When I clicked on All Contacts, it shows Phone, where I back up my phone to and Verizon Cloud. Almost all Contacts had backed up to my phone. It was a nightmare to fix and get added where I 2anted them to be. I had duplicates galore. When I tried to delete or merge the duplicates, IT ADDS THEM BACK AS A 2nd Contact of the same person THAT CANNOT BE ERASED! I don't know it it is because this phone has Linked Accounts at the end of every contact! I think that is the problem.I gave tried 4 times to dictate this to no avail. THIS PHONE HAS BEEN ONE MASSIVE HEADACHE AFTER ANOTHER.  SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND TROUBLE!"
Ace22,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't get ripped buy one!,Verified Purchase,"If you buy the new s21 phones you are getting ripped off. The s21 and the s21 plus went down in ram, display is less, and the ultra starts at 1,400. I want to see Samsung eat these phones and lose money because there just taking advantage of people who don't know any better. So buy an s20 plus gets a lot for your money or but one of these phones they are equally the same as the 21 and the 21 plus.  Thanks for reading"
Zachary Sam,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone but horrible warranty,Verified Purchase,"Phone has worked great for me. It is annoying how big it is but I am slowly getting used to it. I bought it for the large battery and it has worked out great for me. I only really have to charge it once a day unless I am watching videos then maybe twice. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because after 10 months of having it my power on/off button on the side fell out. I have not been ruff with the phone. I haven't dropped it in liquid(s) or on hard surfaces. It just fell out from normal use, phone calls, texts, and watching videos. So far samsung doesn't seem to helpful and it sounds like this is an issue with the phone model, along with the volume button falling out. Hopefully that doesn't happen for me soon. Samsung said that it isn't covered under the warranty and only software issues are covered under the warranty. The were sneaky and sent me an email saying they were going to charge me about $151 in repair fees without even asking me if I was willing to pay."
Jaime,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,"I'm not a gamer with new toy. First thing was to disable/uninstall before temptation sets in. By doing so and using this phone for calls, messages, browsing, photos it is now been a 10 hour day and I still have 85%. The hardest part has-been finding a solution to butt calls to 911. Solved. No lock screen. Not worried as phone is with me. All accounts password protected. All apps are in folders so no problem there. Except I then had to disable ""gestures"" because of all the screens hots while in pocket. Bixby keeps coming on all by itself but somewhere I did see a remove Bixby button.  Must have been once in a lifetime shot. Can't find it again. I think it is in a privacy setting. Pictures are good but honestly my old note 3 can compete. I had used fingerprint which works great but it brings back the chance of 911 calls. They should reconfigure the 911 button to bring up a dialer with just 3 numbers 091, then you can call 911 or operator. I got a case from caselogic and the plate charger has no problem. Also disable the phone suggesting stuff to me. Too stupid. These guys think I bought a traveling billboard. IT IS A PHONE. It would be sad to be addicted to a gamer, kill the battery and not be able to call for help."
Lyn Pierson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone,Verified Purchase,"I got mine through ATT. I havenât had any problems or issues. I use the Google Assistant a lot, and itâs better than Siri on my iPad. It brings up the results pretty fast and is usually accurate. This is really important to me. Battery lasts a long time, I can be on long conversations during the day and still have plenty of battery. Itâs a large screen, which I like, especially having small screens in the past. But itâs smaller from side to side, and itâs perfect for me even though I have smaller hands. My photos are pretty good, Iâm happy with them, and you scale it to way up close.This is a really good phone in my opinion. However, the best phone Iâve had is an Alcatel 3V, but they donât make them anymore. The best battery life is Nokia, but that was when you couldnât access the internet"
Wayne Kraus,1.0 out of 5 stars,Turd,Verified Purchase,"If I sound incoherent it is because I am using this device's is this device's voice to text function is function to write this review to review so that you can see 1st hand you can see 1st hand how buggy this device is this device's.  It's worse, you cannot open the weather app because it will automatically because it will automatically open about 20 crap apps of no  Is possible interest to anyone . So you don't use it. But then it opens its but then it opens itself and it's 20 friends. Isn't uns. It even downloads new apps without it's it's new apps without asking if I want them and keeps changing my keypad and keeps changing my keypad to Greek or Swahili or is Greek or Swahili or Croatian or God knows what period .  Is I am mystified as to why 80% of reviewers gave 5 stars to this piece of junk"
Jim. G,1.0 out of 5 stars,Trash Phone!,Verified Purchase,I had the phone for about year and it works fine in the beginning but the phone began to lock up after system update. I sent it back to Samsung for warranty repair and got my phone back and the problem was never fix and the pin unlock is still not working. So I will stay away from Samsung from now on. I have been using Samsung for over 10 years and this will be my last Samsung phone.
The Dugan,4.0 out of 5 stars,I read all of these comments the phone did not come out until January12 2022.,Verified Purchase,Don't know yet to newI read all of these comments the phone did not come out until January12 2022. Must be conifer or 4g. I order mine from Samsung
David,2.0 out of 5 stars,No eSIM Support,Verified Purchase,"If you plan on traveling internationally and need eSIM support, this phone has eSIM disabled by Samsung.  The hardware is there but for some reason (likely politics between US carriers and Samsung) you cannot use this feature."
Abhinav Joshi,1.0 out of 5 stars,Returned twice. Wont try this phone again!,Verified Purchase,"The first handset had an unresponsive screen and was overheating like crazy.The second one, the replacement, seemed fine out of the box until it started to overheat again and the battery would drain like crazy! Yet again! Also, this phone would just randomly freeze.This was supposed to be my first samsung phone (based upon its great reviews), but, i wont probably ever get a samsung. My 2 year old Mate 20 pro is superior in almost every way!"
D. J. Dil,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your time on this!!!!!!!,Verified Purchase,"got this as a gift, so I returned it ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!no sd card slot!! It's like a bought an Iphone - garbage with limitations! Charging for more memory when sd cards are so cheap...Samsung can shove this phone in the trash with the old exploding phones they made!Go to an older model or a different brand!"
Stationary,2.0 out of 5 stars,Follows the worst iPhone trends,Verified Purchase,"First things first:  it has no headphone jack.  Every phone should have a headphone jack.  Leaving this out was an extremely stupid decision when Apple made it, and an even dumber one when Samsung followed their lead.  If you're going to use a phone in public (as most cellphone users do sometimes!), it's a pretty basic piece of functionality to be able to do that without disturbing those around you.  The official line is that leaving it out left room for a bigger battery, but there's a huge amount of space taken up by the multiple cameras.  Leaving one of those off would have left enough room to include a jack.The description says it ""charges in minutes"", and technically that's true; 200 is a number of minutes.  My S8 Active that the back has almost fallen off charges faster.It's at least easy to set the side button to do something useful now, instead of summoning Bixby; that saves it from a 1-star review.  But Bixby is still there, trying to insert itself into tasks that Google's own tools are already doing better."
Anon,1.0 out of 5 stars,The single most dysfunctional phone I've ever used,Verified Purchase,"Every member of my family got one of these phones when we switched to Verizon a few months ago, and every single one of us has experienced at least one critical failure with these phones. One doesn't receive half of the texts that are sent to it, and it doesn't notify the sender nor receiver that something went wrong. Another will unlock itself randomly while it's in a pocket and start opening everything and anything and then send or submit random gibberish text to anyone and anything it pulls up, and this is despite having the accidental unlock protection on. Mine has had repeated issues with the accidental unlock protection as well, but the icing on the cake was today when it changed my unlock pattern without any input. It was in my pocket since the last time I unlocked it, so it's safe to rule out someone else changing it to mess with me.This phone is a completely unusable piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs. You'd be better off with a Nokia brick phone from the 90s than one of these overpriced plastic turds."
Elle Mim,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you like dissapointment, headaches  and frustration, this phone's for you!!",Verified Purchase,Worst phone I ever purchased. I researched and took time to choose this phone and thought I made a good decision. I was so wrong. Its overbloated with a lot of junk that dosent work. Battery life is terrible and charges incredibly slow. I can't depend on it to go to the store and have it work for me the full trip in case of emergencies. Calling it wireless is funny! It always has a wire for charging attached to it. Im used to Motorola moto z phones. I switched to Samsung to try something new and I'm so sorry that I did.  My heart sunk when I took it out of the box.Never again. I doubted  that it was even new cuz it had a funny sticker on the back  that I had seen on refurbished phones id gotten in past. The most dissapointing purchase of 2020 for me.. oh i bought 2 :>(.  Ugh im stuck till next year boo
Jessica Wells,4.0 out of 5 stars,S20 FE is great!,Verified Purchase,"Great phone for the price! I love the color and style. It's very fast working, great sound, love the non-curved screen!I have seen some glitches with the fingerprint scanner,connection issues, and issues with messaging. Overall,definitely love this phone and always recommend it to other around me !"
cutexy.29,4.0 out of 5 stars,Coming from S7 Egde,Verified Purchase,"So far so good. Item arrive earlier than originally expected.If it does not work on your GSM sim card, do a little troubleshooting before you call your carrier to make the assistance efficient.In my experience, when they activated it, it automatically work as 5G. I got that sim card with the phone carrier early this year. Idk if that makes a difference. I am still exploring but so far so good."
JC,1.0 out of 5 stars,So many problems,Verified Purchase,"Didn't get this phone from Amazon but this is possibly the worst phone you can get. After a few days you'll start to notice so many problems from touches not registering, swiping will occasionally make your screen spaz out or just tap something random, to wifi problems where it'll be connected to wifi but won't give you internet (all my other devices are still connected and work). Texting is a pain when everytime you message someone it's almost a guarantee that you're going to have multiple typos cuz the phone just doesn't function properly more than half the time. Nothing online works to solve anything and updating your phone does nothing.Waste of money-3/10Do not recommend"
OrangeFerriswheel,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you like the simple joy of unlocking your phone with ease, this phone is not for you.",Verified Purchase,"Every time i try to unlock my phone it doesn't register and you have to spam slap the s out of your thumbprint scanner with your thumb a million times before it actually unlocks, the face reco sucks, and i hate all slower methods so it's a giant regret for me. I've tried every option i can possibly find on google/reddit to fix it, but in the end it's just garbage. The rest of the phone is ""decent"" i guess when you can finally unlock it. I'd suggest either buying a cheaper phone and getting the same performance since it doesn't matter when the ease-of-use is not there, and everything else is just kept up to modern standards. Or buy a better phone for 150-200$ more. I'd suggest anything under the 20fe if you like samsung, or a google pixel, orrr any iphone 10 and above. gl."
Victory,3.0 out of 5 stars,Weak glass,Verified Purchase,I got this phone and dropped it while trying to unlock my door which wasn't very high up. I had a sturdy phone case and the glass cracked from the inside out where the fingerprint scanner is so even though I wanted to keep using it it annoyed me because I couldn't feel the cracks but the phone couldn't read my finger prints. I sold it at a phone recycling kiosk for 60 bucks.
basement doc,2.0 out of 5 stars,dim in sunlight - can't take photos outdoors,Verified Purchase,"Bought this phone at AT&T store - good phone overall, except for noted samsung weaknesses, including spotty fingerprint recognition, mediocre front facing camera, but the real weakness is a screen that dims to black on a warm (84F) day in full sunlight.  The phone is not usable outside in bright light after 2 minutes due to overheating and black out of display."
RK,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy!!!,Verified Purchase,I am writing this review just to let everyone know that either some or all of the units have defective touch screen issues. Just Google it and you will find out. Samsung is not very helpful in this matter and their repair option thru ubreakifix wants to just change my screen which is not acceptable option.
.......,1.0 out of 5 stars,I got screwed over by a bad interface to set volumes,Verified Purchase,I couldn't set phone voice volume outside of a phone call (even though I thought I had maxed out every volume option available) and I couldn't hear an important phone call. No headphone jack.
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Phone is OK, Support is terrible",Verified Purchase,"The phone is alright. After about 8-9 months of use the battery life is taking a significant dip. On the other hand, Samsung support is terrible and doesn't listen. I tried to get their help with a minor issue and they dragged it out into a 3 month process and they didn't even attempt to resolve my issue. I'm done with Samsung."
CJ Mack,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bait and switch,Verified Purchase,"Was listed as a prime day deal, but come prime day Amazon said too bad. Samsung said we don't have any deals. Won't be getting any Samsung products again. Too many other better products."
L L.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone IF......,Verified Purchase,Great phone to buy IF Samsung fixes all the screen problems! Some software updates have been released  but problems still persist.
Deanna P.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money and get the s22,Verified Purchase,Camera Picture quality is nothing compared to my note 10 and newer models and the battery life is horrible even after adjusting everything possible. When I looked into trading it in it's not even an option thru Samsung I guess I'm stuck with it. Save your money and by the note 10 or a newer nicer model. Don't settle.
David Reamer,2.0 out of 5 stars,BEWARE--SLIPPERY AND NOT IMPACT-RESISTANT,Verified Purchase,"Phone is nice, a solid upgrade from my S8. But it's basically an air hockey puck and will slip off of flat surfaces unprovoked. The glass is also not impact-resistant. Mine fell 18"" from a living room table while I was on the other side of the room and the screen cracked. $300 to repair after a week of ownership. Oh, and protective cases are on backorder everywhere, so if you order the phone, lock it in a drawer for a few weeks until your Otterbox arrives!"
satisfied customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job - fair quality for the price,Verified Purchase,"I choose Samsung for the Gorilla Glass. I (ab)use my phones and Samsung lasts me. Good size screen, quick response, great reception, for 4G and 5G. The only set back is that there is no headphone jack. Either go Bluetooth or get a C-to-aux converter. If Amazon was smart they would bundle it. The only set back is that when I have heavy data use or am using it on the go instead of my laptop, the battery runs down by the evening."
Mark R,3.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life,Verified Purchase,Not sure about anyone else but after 1 year the battery life is no good. Don't hardly talk ot text and have to charge it once to twice a day. It otherwise been a good phone. Note the battery draining started after a Samsung update and has gotten worse
Patricia Linz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst phone ever,Verified Purchase,This is the worst phone I've ever owned.  Run.  DO. NOT. BUY. My husband was on a trip 4 weeks after purchasing and while walking through the airport it deleted all his data and photos and then locked him out.  Too late to get a refund.  Last week while my phone was in my purse the accessibility mode turned on.  Then would not allow me to reset and eventually froze me out.  It took 2 calls to Verizon and one call to Samsung to get it fixed.  These are horrible phones.  If I could give negative stars I would.
MR,4.0 out of 5 stars,get a glass screen protector,Verified Purchase,"I got my phone at Costco, and I like it for the most part.  I bought a basic protective case without a glass screen.  My phone has dropped 2 times from about 3 feet with the case, and the screen has cracked.  I'm now investing in a case with a glass screen protector.  I don't beat up my phone, but that is just WAY TOO Sensitive."
chris ortiz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Get a a71 5g instead,Verified Purchase,Not worth the money. Get a a71 5g for half the price for more bang for your buck.
BVSHiker,1.0 out of 5 stars,Piece of Crap,Verified Purchase,I HATE THIS PHONE.For starters: The gallery icon disappeared from the text app and I can't get it back.This is typical.  The phone make changes and never shows you how to restore them.
Breanna Vegas,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good but nothing really better,Verified Purchase,"It's good I got this on sale because it's not worth full price. Battery sucks, camera is good but doesn't capture movement very well/easy to blur, the voice text is glitchy and doesn't offer correct words when it guesses wrong, and the Bixby was sssuuupppeerrrr annoying. Also wish it was a touch smaller. MAKE SMALLER PHONE FOR SMALL HAND PPL!If they actually made better phones in 2020 or 2021, I'd get that but honestly there really isn't anything much better xp"
Katie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Failed in 90 days. Stay away.,Verified Purchase,"Device was great for 90 days then the charging port stopped working, and there are millions of hoops to jump through to recitify, even if you purchase the precautions to prevent such occurance.Stay away from this phone if you rely on it for important functions.  It is not up to the job."
Marikate,1.0 out of 5 stars,Touch screen is REALLY glitchy (rarely works),Verified Purchase,"Not a good phone. Does not stand up to other samsungs. Has a lot of glitches that just aren't getting addressed by samsung because its the cheapo version. the touchscreen works maybe 15% of the time. the rest of the time it is ""lights on but nobody home."" the fingerprint reader is absolutely awful. even when the touchscreen is having a good day, the finger print reader never works (it's also in an awkward place). nothing fancy about the screen, functions, or camera. overall very unhappy with it."
Adam,2.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible glass,Verified Purchase,"The phone itself is pretty good, but the glass they use on it is terrible. Try to find what they use, good luck. Corning doesn't list this model as using their glass. If you need to have the glass fixed, it is easily the cheapest of the Samsung phones to repair. My phone fell 1 foot onto a wood floor and cracked all the way across. Cheapest replacement glass, no listed version of what they use, and it breaks after a laughably minor fall = bad glass. Do not buy this phone. But any other version of the S20 or a S21, they at least admit they use good glass on those."
mfshs,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It doesn't matter what is the phone, since you need to deal with Samsung's crappy apps",Verified Purchase,"This phone is garbage since Samsung wants to force its apps on the customer. There is a so called ""Free"" app that wants to push contents on you. There is no way to get rid of it. It is always open and as you switch apps, it comes right as the first option"
Michelle Lavergne,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fragile,Verified Purchase,"The specs are great the camera isn't the best but you shouldn't expect it. The only thing wrong with the plastic back is that it's way too slick, even the edges. But the worst thing and the reason you shouldn't buy this phone is because the used old gorilla glass the break really really easy. Including the camera glass. Do no buy. Doesn't matter the rest of the specs if your phone shatters with the slightest fall. Look this up if you don't believe me."
Wade,5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall great phone. Best bang for your buck.,Verified Purchase,"9/10 I have had this phone for about a month, waited to write a review to see if I was going to run into any issues, the only slightly negative thing I can think of is the facial recognition doesn't register a lot, unless I'm holding the phone at a certain angle. And the finger print sensor might take two trys sometimes. The camera is amazing, the battery life is even better. Charge time is quick, I had a note 9 before this and I am very pleased. Ignore bad reviews. I gave this phone time to have issues and found none."
LIberatus,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fingerprint reader is worse than the LG and Asus phones I've had,Verified Purchase,Battery life is bad but not horrible.Samsung software is like a virus you can't delete
AMAZON CUSTOMER ,3.0 out of 5 stars,3 stars for cuteness or easy connection to my mobile provider,Verified Purchase,Cute phone. Feels a little plastic and light weight. Has a bad battery or something but I didn't have any problems with getting it to connect to my mobile network. My mobile network is T-Mobile/Metro.
PG,3.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung CS wasn't the best,Verified Purchase,"This review is for the experience buying this phone directly from samsung.Trade-in, purchased worked okThey offered 6 months free spotify but it never worked. CS doesn't help but asks me to directly contact spotify"
Patience,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great but could be better.,Verified Purchase,"Needed to get a most feature phone and must admit I'm quite satisfied, although most of the time I have LTE+ on the network bar instead of 5g, and the battery life is not that awesome. I don't use my phone that often with stuff like you tube or social medias but I have to charge it every night."
Bryan J,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as my budget mrola,Verified Purchase,About the same performance as my budget phone. Unbelievable how much more money. I do not recommend.  Won't buy another Samsung phone.
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing Piece of Junk,Verified Purchase,"Don't waste your money on this phone. Retired my s8 and got a new phone with the same issues - lousy battery,  screen freezes, and GPS does not work. Piece of junk for $700."
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,very little memory,Verified Purchase,Phone works fine but not enough memory.
E,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best new release phone,Verified Purchase,Great all around phone. I have never had a samsung phone before. This phone is solid all around and an upgrade from my LG G7. I love getting 5G signal all over the place. The phone's battery lasts all day. The screen is crisp. The camera is great.
chase j.,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Must Buy,Verified Purchase,Absolutely the best phone to buy and have in 2021 it's perfect for everything you need trust me definitely a must have .Also the battery life on this phone is extraordinary.

MYGguy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Flagship phone for $750,Verified Purchase,"I love this phone. It cost only $750, tops. I'm upgrading from the Galaxy S9. Although I can't find many changes, I can see that it's much faster. And all the previous features have been upgraded to present day standard."
roland wethington,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,"Great phone, don't like being forced to use a password or anything to unlock the phone everything I try to use it. The Galaxy 10 plus was not like this."
SUSAN LEO,1.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung Galaxy FE 5G Issues,Verified Purchase,"trying to group apps into folders. When I select the app I want to group, normally it should show other apps that I can drop it on & create a folder. the Galaxy S20 FE 5G sometimes lets you do that & most of the time doesn't show any other apps that you want to group them with. I wish LG still made cell phones because this phone is a POS which is short for piece of crap."
IvÃ¡n Dario Barahona Coffin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointment brother.,Verified Purchase,"I do not like the thickness of the phone, to be ultimate and high-end, very thick. (Same thickness of phones in the last 4 years) Ididn't come headphones, and the description indicates that they would come hands-free. Something slow in certain apps. Fingerprint reader very good. Easy recognition very well. Battery life similar to Galaxy Note 8 (The one I've used for almost 4 years) Idon't buy Samsung again, I'll try Apple."
Levy Ngu Fuanyi,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good .,Verified Purchase,The phone is a good phone overall butThe front facing camera is blurry in low light  and the selfie makes your teeth somehow browner which is not good for a selfie lover.Wish they fix this on update.
Jullian Phipps,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap,Verified Purchase,The phone feels awkward in your hand. The back of the phone feels like cheap plastic. The phone is not compatible with the stylist pen and the phone isnât compatible with Samsung tv.

UU,1.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung Pay doesn't work for all S20 FEs depending on your region,Verified Purchase,"I bought the S20 FE so I could utilize the MST payment feature in Samsung Pay but since I received an International version of the phone, Samsung Pay does not work in the US. It is ridiculous that a Samsung app on a Samsung phone does not work in the US."

J Miller,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't keep phone in pocket!,Verified Purchase,"I keep my phone in my pocket and the phone regularly opens apps by itself and even makes phone calls. Samsung has an ""Accidental Touch Protection"" setting but it does not prevent what I described. It is sooo annoying I would not have bought the phone had I known."
Dav e,1.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung is awful,Verified Purchase,Works as it pleases
Will,1.0 out of 5 stars,Garbage phone dont buy,Verified Purchase,Phone lags a lot and constantly have to reboot it. Certain apps cause the phone to wig out. My S8+ that was 3 years old was better than this phone and i wish i still had it

marquinhos,4.0 out of 5 stars,price,Verified Purchase,Good
Chuck ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best Midrange phone,Verified Purchase,"This phone is a lot better than expected. Coming from the s10+, I was worried that I would be completely disappointed. The s20fe feels premium despite having a plastic back. This is due to its thickness and weight. The plastic feels premium and the cloud mint doesn't leave visible fingerprints. The phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865; the phone feels very smooth. The 120hz refresh rate also adds to the smoothness of the experience. 6gb of ram is sufficient for the vast majority of users. My s10+ plus had 8gb and I felt like I could have an endless amount of apps open. The same could be said with this phone. The cameras are quite good but I'd recommend testing out the phone in person. Yes... the 1080p display looks fine. You will not be able to tell the difference unless you get a magnifying glass or put your eye right up to the display. If you are coming from the s8 or and older phone, this phone is worth picking up.*Update, I'm really satisfied with the performance of the phone. Battery life with the 120hz screen is acceptable and can still last the whole day with moderate use. The rear camera is nice but the front facing camera leaves more to be desired. The performance is definitely there with the Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of ram. I used to use a phone with 8gb of ram and I don't notice a difference (I always have multiple apps open). My original opinion still stands. There have also been reports of touchscreen issues. This has not affected me. Samsung sent out an update to correct this issue for those who had it.Second Update (March 18th 2021) Nothing much to add about the phone. My original opinion still stands. The fingerprint scanner can be a pain sometimes but works the majority of the time. Samsung has been doing a good job updating this phone too. I just wish this phone had a headphones jack (at least it has expandable storage)."
Kim,4.0 out of 5 stars,Happy for the price I paid,Verified Purchase,"I bought this phone because I wasn't willing to spend a grand on the S20/ or note. Plus on Amazon it saved me an extra 100. I have tmobile. And I switched my sim out from my S9. Phone calls and texting worked immediately but it took me a couple hours to get the mobile data running. But after I restarted the network I am now on 5G.I did not receive my headset. I reached out to Amazon and I'll see what they say. If not I'll reach out to Samsung. This phone is larger than my S9 but I love the screen size even though it's not easy to hold for me with one hand. It is a beautiful phone. Screen has amazing color. And it is quite fast. Downer is the battery life. I've been on it for a couple hours and I'm down to 62% but it did charge really fast. From what I did see of the camera in low light the picture did come out nice for being at night. 3 different settings are on upon opening it. Zoom back, regular and zoom in. I'll see what the pictures look like in the day. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. Just hope that the battery life gets fixed. It's a nice alternative for getting a new phone at a not so large price tag."
Frosty Legacy,2.0 out of 5 stars,not happy about the phone,Verified Purchase,"Just Got My Samsung Galaxy S20 FE yesterday and I open and tested it if it is a good phone....it is a nice looking phone, but the problem is it was heating up and drained the battery to fast.....only 4/5 hrs of use time at fully  charge!"
Jason G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loving it so far,Verified Purchase,"I was waiting for the Pixel 5 which came out the same time. The 5 was $100 more ($699) than Amazon's price of S20 FE of $599 at release (*S20 FE now $699) with the 5 using processing power of a few generations back with smaller battery capacity - this was a no brainer choice and Google over priced their flagship (I understand their camera is generally good and updates faster/ui cleaner - but that's not making up for everything else especially considering competition from this phone and OnePlus among others).It's still brand new so time will tell a lot more but the phone is snappy and my wifi & cell signal are faster than my Honor View 10 that's being replaced. I use T-mobile and not in a 5G area yet (but one is close by I'll be able to test). I attached a pic of my speed test info on cell network. The bottom 2 similar results are default with 5G enabled in the cellular settings and the top (fastest) results is with the second option of 4G LTE/3/2 enabled. I thankfully read a post to disable 5G if not in network for one. My old phone would only get 25 download on average so the S20 FE has blown that away even at its worst.I took a photo in an average edge lit room of some colored items and a pic in a very low light room (any light coming in is from a room at least 10ft away). I'm blown away by the low light pic - I can't explain how well lit the pic is compared to what my eyes perceive.The first day I spent my time uninstalling and disabling whatever I could that was pre-installed by Samsung and tweaked shortcuts & and new to me (Samsung specific) features I wanted. I used the recommended Smart Switch to transfer files from my old phone (namely apps, selected pics, and texts & call records) and I used my saved backup from my launcher (Nova) to bring back the app/screen organization I had customized on my old phone. Now I get to enjoy.It does charge fast and no problems connecting to 2 different Bluetooth headsets.*Update* I realized my original download speed pic was clipped wrong (showed a 2G wifi download speed instead of LTE) so I removed the old and uploaded correct pic (speed increase still stands).I placed prices in as they've changed since I purchased.You can choose to bring your screen refresh to 60 to help extend battery (defaults at 120 - I recommend scrolling feeds and testing both out in other scenarios to see if it's worth it for you). As always, to extend battery on any phone, control background apps and their access, lower your screen brightness when able and keep GPS, wifi, Bluetooth off when not needed. If your phone has bad reception in an area you spend a prolonged period of time in and you don't need to call/text, put your phone in airplane mode and turn wifi on after (if wifi available/needed)."
Don't worry about it,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay but nothing special,Verified Purchase,"ProsThe phone is quick loading appsDual speakers instead of one speakerFinger print scanner and face rec have worked without issueConsConsidering what is available nowadays the camera quality is mediocre. Should have just put a better main camera and deleted the 30x zoom lense that's just too pixelated for distance shots.Battery life barely makes it through a day even with the phone on medium power saving/disabled app background usage. (Battery drained 10% in 10 hours overnight while not even being used)No port for headphone.Overall I could have gotten a cheaper phone and lived without things like face rec and in screen finger print scanner, wireless charging, etc. Would prefer better battery life and better camera."
Michelle ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tough, durable, awesome phone!",Verified Purchase,"First off, love this phone. Works great for all my needs, and other reviews cover that well.Now the important thing for me- 3 weeks after putting this phone in service, I left it on the roof of my car. After retracing my drive home, I found it in the middle of a 4 lane road by constantly calling it as we drove along the shoulder of the road. Obviously it had been ran over multiple times during the hour and a half it sat there, but the ringing led us straight to it. The only damage was a shattered Supershieldz screen protector and scuffed Otterbox Defender case- the phone is still in perfect condition. True testament to this phones durability, including the gurrilla glass- I still can't believe I'm typing this review on the same phone that was run over multiple times and still laying in the middle of a lane a few short hours ago.Way to Samsung- you have a customer for life!"
terry,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall it Delivers!  If you are ok with screen,Verified Purchase,"i had the following questions:1. would it really be new out of the box?2. would it be functional given the mid price range ?3. would changing sim/switching from old phone work well?The answers:1. It was brand new in every way down to the box with factory seal.  Flawless condition2. Now keep in mind i switched from a much older galaxy S6. I dont care too much re the camera.  With these in mind, the phone works great and delivers all the performance you would expect.The ONE MAJOR thing to keep in mind: Even next to the old S6 (higher screen resolution), the screen looks a little shabby when set at the same brightness.  The contrast of dark letters is not so crisp/sharp as a higher resolution screen.  i adjusted to this by increasing the brightness.  But that means much less battery life.3. Changing Sim/converting the phone was very easy and 5G network registered immediatelyConclusion: You have to be ok with a less sharp, less bright screen, and mid range camera.  You can overcome the screen a little by increasing brightness but then battery life is less.If you are ok with these trade offs, this is a great phone and delivered brand new just as advertised."
BigRed,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dank phone bruh,Verified Purchase,"This phone is pretty sick, I came from a galaxy s8 plus 4 gig with an exynos cpu, which had died and wouldn't turn back on. So I decided to just go with this, its fast and has a great display, takes good pics and all that. Its definitely a good bang for your buck. There is something just slightly off about the touch screen its literally nothing big its like my s8nalways hit the numbers to unlock even if I was typing super quick but sometimes this phone will maybe miss a key press but its rare."
N. Schumann,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cloud orange is more light peach,Verified Purchase,"Love this phone, very pleased with finger print reader... However you can only record 3 different fingers. Very good phone - excellent camera, especially front facing!My only complaint, why it was 4 stars instead of 5 was we bought the orange color phone for my husband and when it came it was more of a light peach/pinky color. A nice color, but obviously more girly than anticipated. It's an easy fix to cover up, but we were disappointed because the color online looks more orange than it actually is."
Txagengr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone with great battery life.,Verified Purchase,"Did a lot of research after my old favorite LG phone's battery slowly died.  This phone was categorized as something of a 3rd tier phone, and kind of the economy model of S21.  Some of the ""experts"" has some critical comments about it, but I decided to give it a shot.  So far, this has been a great phone that I'd recommend highly.  Battery life has been terrific - up to 2+ days per charge - photos are very good, it's a good, easy to hold size and the 256GB of storage should be all I need.  The phone is much faster than my old LG.  It may not be considered a 1st tier phone, but it's all I need.  My only criticism is that the phone is a little slick, which makes it feel like it could easily slip out the hand.  The addition of a slim case solved that issue."
K G,4.0 out of 5 stars,Trash more trash,Verified Purchase,"So I got this phone around 12pm, activated it with tmobile around 2. Got a screen and case for the thing. First review was in regards to the box not being wrapped and there was ALOT of dust on the screen. If the phone is new why is there dust and a thin screen protector thats slapped on sideways. Fortunately for these folks I already did to much to the phone to want to go that far to return. however I would of returned based on the face I just spent from 4pm to now at 8pm trying to successfully update my phone. This is my SECOND S20FE and im very technology savvy. For I use to work for Apple, but I prefer galaxy all the way. But why do I have a brand new phone and I have to to through articles hard resets, updating over and over again just for it to tell me its not updated again! Well finally at 8pm and me not giving up not wanting to have to return the phone I finally was able to successfully update the phone. I called Amazon HELP and they hung up on me. All the way I want to give the phone amazon and SAMSUNG 2 STARS 1 star because I still love galaxy and the other star for my self I guess cause no help from amazon or samsung I fixed it myself. Oh and im also very upset that u locked samsung phones don't have the read receipt feature have to download messages and that even took me another half hour reading articles and discovered on the forum I had to download the carrier services app to even be able to use messages chat features. Even though it says my phone should be compatible to use at this point im just tired....I'll end up buying another phone down the line but right now I don't have time and I guess ill just be grateful for the time being.... will NEVER order from samsung again I guess to get all features you have to be a SLAVE to a carrier!!!"
Mike G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice pocket computer with built in phone app.,Verified Purchase,"After a couple of weeks I really like this phone.  It's fast and has a beautiful screen, big but not too big.  My S7 died so I had to upgrade, this was a major upgrade for me.  I will not buy a phone without an SD card slot so that eliminated the S21 and iPhone right off the bat.  My pictures are on the SD card and a backup of my call logs and SMS messages so I didn't really lose anything, the rest was backed up to my Google account.  I like that I can take photos and video in UHD at 21:9 aspect ratio so they fit my monitor.  Not bad for the price, I hope it lasts 4 years like my S7 did.  The S7 was the only one that ever died on me, I have my original Galaxy, an S3, S5, S7 (dead) and my Samsung flip phone still.  Now the S20 FE and I can definitely recommend it."
B. Whatley,5.0 out of 5 stars,A flagship phone without the flagship price,Verified Purchase,"I have had the phone for about two weeks. After waiting on TCL 10l 5G, Oneplus Nord (that didn't launch state side)_, and Google Pixel 4a 5G/Pixel 5 I had to jump on on this phone. I was able to get the phone for $100 less then Pixel 5 with a stronger processor by preordering the phone. Another plus is I also got a $70 Samsung gift card for preordering the phone. This is my 3rd Samsung phone since the S3. Sadly their phone were getting too expensive with only two years worth of updates.The Positive: The phone comes with the latest flagship processor,120 hz display, dual speakers with Dolby Atmos, and at least 3 years of updates. It comes with fast wireless charge, power share, the underside doesn't feel cheap, and battery last me the whole day between work and playing games. ""The 1st thing that came to mind when I turned the phone on was how I have been missing out on how beautiful Samsung's amoled screens are on.""The bad: It comes with gorilla glass 3 I would invest in a screen protector. The  phone doesn't come with a 25w super fast charger I guess to keep the cost and it is missing a USB c to c cable to transfer data. (the 15W fast charger it comes with takes about 1hr 30 mins to fully charge my phone while the $12 super charge I bought of Amazon takes exactly 1 hr to charge my phone to 100%  Another negative for me is Samsung UI which will delay Android 11. My second thought after 1 hour was ""I don't miss Samsung horrible UI and I would prefer a more vala android experience.""  I really shouldn't have to use a second launcher like Nova to customize my phone.Overall: This phone is feature proof with 5G (won't be viable for another 3 years) and 3 years  worth of updates. I am very excited about the phone and look forward to Samsung releasing more affordable phones with flagship specs in future. Definitely a better value then any other phone on the market if you can live with Samsung UI.Oddity with 5G not the phones fault: I have tested 5G and 4G on T-Mobile network and for some odd reason I get half the speed 4G gives me. (5G is definitely still in its infant stage and don't expect any real speed differences to come until 2022 with 2025 being reality.)"
kd,1.0 out of 5 stars,not new item,Verified Purchase,"waited forever for this phone to go on sale. Finally bought it on black friday. However, the phone i received was clearly an opened box: screen plastic film was the wrong fit, the box seal was not original, the wire was not in a tight bundle.Be careful with Amazon, it is starting to ship opened box/returned items as new items!!! I just cant believe that they are doing this with high value items such as cell phones now... extremely disappointed."
Austin A.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't seem brand new,Verified Purchase,I just want to say the battery life is pretty bad for the size of the battery and it seemed like I didn't get a brand new phone. My package came with no plastic wrap around it. The box was closed with tape but very loosely. As well as there being dust inside the box when opening it. Kind of suspect in my opinion. But only time will tell I guess.
Isaac,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very little durability,  no cases at launch?",Verified Purchase,"i dropped the phone from literally less then a 1 foot drop and the camera cracked  theres no cases available for a couple more werks which is almost asking for people to break there devices, camera sucks, they expect you to not drop it when the material itself if very slippery and smooth, big fail from samsung i wpuldnt buy this phone save your money"
Charles McGehee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Long battery life.  Good features.  Good camera system.,Verified Purchase,"I love this phone.  The camera system could be the best out presently.  The ability to add memory.  I can' not imagine what I DON'T yet know about this outstanding phone.  The reception and clarity are great. Noise and dropouts have yet to happen.  This is a very fast operating phone.  The sound is great.  Got mine on sale for $599.99 (Amazon) and could not be happier. Amazon is an authorized seller.  Avoid 3rd party's if you want the warranty intact.  Contact any dealer before you buy to be certain the phone is new and under full warranty.  Samsung can also answer this.  Be sure to put a good protective cover on it.  Also.  Some complain that when they install a screen protector the tough sensitivity and fingerprint ID don't work well.  There is a simple menu setting to adjust touch sensitivity under SETTING's.  This solves the issue.  Even without a case, this is a well built phone.  But use a lanyard so if you do drop it, it won't hit the ground.  Best phone out there for the money.  5g ready and acts as a hot pot too."
Airmanchambers,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good update from my galaxy S10.,Verified Purchase,"The Galaxy S10 has a raised curved screen so the sides can be used to scroll and get flashing notifications. There are no cases that can protect the screen, replaced broken screen protectors all the time.  The Galaxy S20 FE G5 has dropped in price and you can buy cases that protect it.  The screen protectors glass work well because the screen is not raised as much. 5G is faster than 4glite and gets more bars in our area where 4G lite is poor. Also T-Mobileâs new 5G home internet can use 4G Lite bands for large movie streaming users.  My 4G phone internet has slowed down on T-Mobile. Need to upgrade my other phone to 5G. Galaxy S20 FE has a plastic case with a metal band around the outside. I always use a good case so didnât need to pay for the S20âs with stronger housingâs. Great upgrade for 5G and save money if you use a case and screen protector."
Devon Hartman,5.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't know I needed a new phone this badly- Best bang for your buck right here,Verified Purchase,"Upgraded from Galaxy S6 to this S20FE and it's night and day difference. Mild use of phone daily and battery is still 89% at the end of the day. Comes with battery option to stop charging at 85% to save your battery as well if you're interested. Great features all around. No 3.5mm but USB C dongle works just fine if you buy one separately. Can hook up USBC to HDMI and use it like it's own little computer or stream to a TV which is crazy. Can play PS Remote Play on monitor/tv if you hook it up that way. No controller lag with PS4 controller, both original and updated."
ceehee,5.0 out of 5 stars,No Regrets,Verified Purchase,"I previously used the A71 4G (international version) and loved that phone. However, it had severe signal problems after I moved to a new area, so I started looking for a US version 5G phone. I was considering the A71 5G or the new A52, but I couldn't find one unlocked that would arrive quickly enough. Then I remembered this phone and boom...exactly what I needed, and for just a bit more money than the A52. I don't absolutely need flagship specs, but I must say that I'm enjoying the upgrade from my A71. Everything works flawlessly and fast. Camera is excellent. I do miss the headphone jack, but I got an adapter that works fine. If you're buying unlocked, I think this is a better deal than a new A-series Galaxy!"
PAT ZICARI,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST SAMSUNG FOR THE $$$,Verified Purchase,"WAS going to buy an S21 5Gâ¦ glad I didnâtâ¦This gives you great features PLUS external memory card accessâ¦ which Iâd rather haveâ¦ larger capacity of storage and removable JUST in case phone screws upâ¦ most newer phones donât seem to have external... e.g. 5 S21'sHad almost a month and STILL putting in apps I NEED.. lolGREAT pictures and videoâ¦ super clear with Night Modeâ¦Video and itâ SOUNDâ¦ did a short video in the Van Gogh Immersive Experience with super Loud musicâ¦ audio was perfectâ¦ not overly compressed and sounding true to live as you can get from a PHONEâ¦(I used Master music for TV, Movies, CDsâ¦ so DO have an earâ¦ lol)â¦Anyway... GREAT phone for the $$$"
BAJUNGADUSTIN,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best phone deal in history.,Verified Purchase,"Amazing phone for the price.I would say price per feature this is the best deal I have ever got on a phone in my life. Upgrading from an s8+ I wouldn't know what could possibly even be better on the s21 models that just came out.I used to be all about the latest phones but it gets tiresome after a while. If you are looking for a cheap phone without sacrificing anything in terms of quality.. This is the phone for you. Amazing speed, amazing pictures, fast  and snappy."
Whoaaaski,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth the coin, easy buy probably the best phone at a budget",Verified Purchase,"My girlfriend loves it, it's probably the best phone she's ever had. Everything on this FE is amazing the Face recognition is on point, fingerprint reader is fast as he'll and you can store up to three fingers which is awesome. The battery life is well you know it's pretty much the same as all Samsung devices. But all and all it is a great phone and the price you can not beat. I the S21 and the S20 FE is just as good as mine."
Joseph CÃ¡ceres,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone for the price,Verified Purchase,"I've been using it for over two weeks and I have no problem at all. It came from a S7 Edge and the jump is amazing, the battery will last approximately up to 10 hours of screen with my normal use, the fluidity of the screen at 120 Hz is noticeable and makes overall feel much faster the entire interface and application usage. For me it's no problem that the back is plastic as it seems to me that it still feels great at hand and does not lose the look of premium cell phone, plus it is more resistant than glass to drops. It has wireless charging, reversible charging and a 15W fast charge charger, which could be included 25W in the box already for the price, but it is not too drama either. The cameras are very good in definition and quality and overall is a great phone for everyday use. Recommended."
crazyhorse357,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,"Just got it yesterday,  and so far I am very happy with the phone. I upgraded from an S7 Galaxy, this one is much faster and has a lot of great features.  The changeover of my data was fairly painless as well. I think most people would be  happy with it. Wasn't too sure about the color when I ordered it , but I find that it is kind of nice to have one that doesn't  blend in with whatever I put it down on. Also nice to have one that doesn't look like every other phone out there!"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Screen smashed after falling from less than one feet,Verified Purchase,I was seating on the curb and my phone fell out of my pocket crashing screen. It was less than 1 feet height!
CMB30,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful Phone!,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this at discounted price and waited til it was in stock and then shipped.  It easily was set up with service with Tracfone using T Mobile SIM 5G.  The camera on this phone is unlike any other phone I have had.  I love it!!  Was worth every penny I paid for it.  I do not feel that is heavy, clumsy, etc...Color is beautiful!"

Madison,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't charge,Verified Purchase,I got the phone july 5th. I haven't even had it a month yet and this morning when I plugged the phone in to charge it started smoking and the charging port on the phone now smells burnt. They refunded me my money but now I have to try to find a phone for the same price. I don't understand why they couldn't just send me a replacement phone. Huge inconvenience and now I have no phone until I buy a new one since I can't charge this one.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone,Verified Purchase,While this is a great phone and big improvement from my old J7 I strongly recommend either Amazon or the seller make a bigger effort to inform the buyer that you also need a 5G SIM card. Maybe try the bundle offer and it would be more obvious that the phone does NOT come with a SIM card.
J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Over all a great phone,Verified Purchase,The fingerprint took a little bit to recognise my finger but it a lil more efficiently. Its a normal samsung battery life and charge. Keep in mind there is no port to plug your headphones in so you'll need a jack
Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Decent Samsung phone at great price,Verified Purchase,"Battery holds up ok, drains from 100 to about 93 percent within 10 to 15 min of very minimum use after taking it off the charger. After that, battery last all day. Screen is fluid and processor is fast. The finger print reader is a bit slow. Face unlock is very quick. Camera quality is great. Night time picture looks as if it was taken at sunset.Would love to see the 8 gb ram version in the 5g model. Overall the price is decent for a mid range phone."
Willa Dixon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my phone,Verified Purchase,Love this phone! great replacement for my old phone and very happy that I could take my sim card out if my old phone and put in this phone. Skipped Verizons upcharge and high phone price and I may never buy a phone from them again lol. Glad I made this purchase. This phone also had SD slot for those that need that like I do... The face recognition and fingerprint security work great too.
M G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy!,Verified Purchase,"This phone is great!  I'm not sure how the flagship version is better, because this has everything I could want, and for a savings of about $500, I'm very happy I chose this model!  Works great.  Great camera.  Battery life is LONG.  Face recognition is not the best choice, right now, because of masks, so I can't speak to that, but the fingerprint reader is on point."
Carol Wilde,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 g network and battery life.,Verified Purchase,"Upgrade to previous smartphone. It is a nice phone, larger in size but still suitable for pocket carrying. It charges quickly and holds a charge for the entire day. A very good camera and I am pleased with the S20 and did not feel it was an advantage to go to the S21."

Ethan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great so far,Verified Purchase,"Loving this do far. Everything is so fast and smooth, response time, load time, recognition, etc. Only complaint is I feel like the battery drain faster than I'd like. After about 8 hours of listening to podcast, it's at about 30%."
myTerminal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great successor to my wife's S9,Verified Purchase,"Though the phone doesn't quite match to the standards the S9 set in our minds, the phone itself is great. The plastic back feels like a downgrade from the glass back in her S9, but overall she seems to be happy."
Patricia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good buy,Verified Purchase,I am very happy with my new samsung S20 FE 5G but there is something I didn't find in the box where it came and it is very important to me: LA GARANTIA.

carolyn grahame,4.0 out of 5 stars,Still very new,Verified Purchase,"So far, I really like it.  Some features are taxing my nerves, but I expected that since I am technology challenged.  It was easy to change from my old galaxy and still have everything I had before, only better and more."
Dee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great upgrade!,Verified Purchase,"I upgraded from the Samsung S8 and this so far has been great.  Pictures are crisp and clear, runs quickly.  The only thing I found is that the battery life is not all that great but I am also using the phone a lot."

R Parks,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice for the price,Verified Purchase,Brought this during a Prime Special so the price was excellent. Very easy to use and looking forward to all the tricks and short cuts it can offer cause I'm still learning all it's features and I like the size.
Auria Star,5.0 out of 5 stars,great,Verified Purchase,Good product. Totally recommended!
KDK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,Love this phone! It works well and would suggest to anyone to buy it. The flat glass is a good improvement over the curved glass of the last one!
James S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,The SD card slot is on the back of the SIM card slot.,Verified Purchase,I have no clue what items the phone is supposed to ship with.  I was surprised that this was a used (Amazon terminology is renewed) phone and the price was almost  that of a new phone.  I don't use fingerprint readers nor face recognition.  I have no idea about the battery as it is a used phone (maybe the battery is OK).  I had to Google search to find out where the SD card went.  I chose the S20 instead of an S21 for the SD card slot.
Lexie,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok,Verified Purchase,"I love the phone. I am having some issues with carrying it in my back pocket, the screen doesn't want to work for a few minutes. And when I try to scroll, it clicks on things."

Carlos Alfredo Garcia Vidal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,Verified Purchase,The phone is good what it owes me are the photos sometimes do not turn out well from there everything fluid although it lacks a certain application as an example to be able to record the conversation
Luis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best deal,Verified Purchase,Best phone I've got for a good price every thing about is worth each penny. The plastic back doesn't feel cheap. I can actually get a grip on it with out a case not like other phones with glass all over that slip off my hand consistently
deanna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,Verified Purchase,I'm totally happy with this purchase. I haven't had it set up long enough to do face recognition . battery life seems to be OK. The power cord does not work and quick guide is for a different phone but other than that it's great.
TQMan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviews were accurate,Verified Purchase,"I did some research on the S20 vs the S21. The reviews were accurate. Although its not the latest Samsung product, the S20 is just as good as the S21. For my needs, the differences were minor and the refurbished price was too good to be true."

Lady73,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hey S21FE,Verified Purchase,So I have to agree with you all on Samsung. I've also been A fan of them I recently had the 10SE for 24 months they offered A trade . I got the phone.  It's not charging and the phone is burning my hand.  I feel within the past several prior to COVID-19 Samsung has gone down hill in their product's. So I have agree don't waste your money on this new S21FE either  it came out on the 12 my birthday and I'm very disappointed.
Tom Langenstein,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh!,Verified Purchase,"I upgraded (?) from the Samsung S9. I've only had this phone for a few weeks,  but here are my first impressions. Looks like I'm going to have to spring for another set of $100 + for Bluetooth headphones since this phone doesn't have an audio port for them. I often use headphones for an extend period of time. When the battery dies, I just plugged them in and go. No more! Funny the literature promotion for this phone didn't include this downgrade. I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition features because they are unreliable. The display is so responsive to touch that the phone wanders all over the internet while in my pocket despite all attempts to make it not do that in the settings. Other than that, it's a decent phone. I may just keep it until I find something that fits my needs better."
Carlos,3.0 out of 5 stars,A very good phone only...,Verified Purchase,"This is an incredible cell phone (but for me I came from a much worse cell phone), its construction, its screen, its fluidity, everything was incredible... until the big bugs began, I don't know why I experience so many bugs in apps like  YouTube and some games, I do not know if it is a factory error or what, but in the cameras I notice a small fluff that is in a camera (it does not bother the camera) and I already confirmed it and it is not a scratch or a stain that can  clean."
Dean,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone,Verified Purchase,"The voice quality is very clear and the two buttons works well.  The screen size fits me well. The picture quality is great. I need some time to get used to the screen unlock gesture because it seems to be easily confused with the camera function.  I have also been directed to Samsung Pay without intention of using it. Overall, I think I have made the right choice."
bjhaught,3.0 out of 5 stars,I want my search engine to be my choice Google  controls this phone,Verified Purchase,I like this phone but it has driven me crazy.  The apps keep changing. Things disappear . It has had more problems to work out than any other samsung I've had but still a good phone

Mark Milner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing phone!,Verified Purchase,I love this phone! Had S8+ for 5 years and have to say with the exception of a few sensors and appearance this phone is great for less than half the cost !

Shawnda Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best phone ever,Verified Purchase,So I love this  phone easy to use an the camera  is everything! Battery life is amazing.
Oscar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality,Verified Purchase,"Already almost 2 months of using it works perfectly, meeting all the standards of a cell phone in this range. The only one but I would give it would be the weight that makes it a little uncomfortable, but the battery lasts me between a whole day of continuous use to 2 days of little use. Ps: buy him a 500G SD and it works perfect."
Sean Kim,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything is good except for delivery,Verified Purchase,I have bought it at Thanksgiving. Everything in the phone make me happy but delivery. I received it 8th Dec. I knew that it was a pre-order but delivery was later than expected.
