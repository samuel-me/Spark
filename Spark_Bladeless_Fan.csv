Rachel L. Rowell,5.0 out of 5 stars,AWESOME HEATER,Verified Purchase,"I work from my home office and sitting so long, I get cold even though we have central heat. I bought this smaller oscillating heater after my old one, which was taller, died. This one is about 18 inches tall but it totally puts out enough heat to heat the entire room so I am not cold anymore. Of course you can adjust the heat up or down and turn the oscillator on or off as suits your needs. The fan is super quiet too, even when oscillating. I would highly recommend this unit to anyone who needs a secondary heat source. It also has the safety tip-over feature so if it tilts or falls over, and the button on the bottom is no longer in contact with the floor or other hard surface it sits on, the heater automatically shuts off until it is put in the upright position again."
Rosebud,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,Verified Purchase,Didn’t want to spend a fortune on a Dyson fan so I hoped this fan would be a close enough version.  It has 3 speeds; the Low speed is quiet but useless because you can’t feel it so you have to have it on Medium or High. On High it’s pretty loud.  I hoped since it’s so tall that it would really put out some air but I get about the same amount out of my old oscillating fan. This fan is about 4ft tall and you get about a 12in area where there’s air coming out. There’s no way to adjust the height so if you don’t like where the air is blowing you’re out of luck. It doesn’t oscillate very far in either direction either.  The sleep function was weird in that the fan constantly turns itself off and on.  Didn’t like that either. Save your money and try a different fan. Update: After giving the fan to my husband to use he found another serious flaw; when he would adjust the tv volume with the remote control it also turns the fan off. Saw online others having the same problem. This fan is being returned back to Amazon.
Michael R,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly as Described,Verified Purchase,Echoing the headline above this product is exactly as described in the product description.  It is simple to operate and offer the settings and output that I desired for a small room needing an auxiliary heat source
R. Carlson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good heater, but Oscillation feature is wonky",Verified Purchase,"Like many of the other reviewers, I would rate this heater high on it's heating ability and it's quiet operation. It runs at about 55DB, about the noise you'd hear in a quiet library. The thermostatic feature is pretty good about holding to a specific temperature. The orange/black color scheme is a bit of a acquired taste, but I could have gotten used to it. There is a slight issue with the controls - there's just a large knob on the top and you select low heat, high heat or (I'm assuming) high heat with thermostatic control. You cannot select thermostatic control with low heat. Speaking of the thermostat, like most similar units, the thermostat is not calibrated to s particular temperature, you just pick a place on the dial and back it off or advance until you reach a comfortable temperature.The one problem I have with the unit is that the oscillation feature is not integrated to the thermostat. It's a switch on the lower back of the unit, hard to reach. This means that if you want to use oscillation with the thermostatic feature, when the unit is not blowing air, the heater continues to oscillate left to right.It's spooky. It makes a very slight sound . It's nodding it's head in disapproval.  It's judging you.....OK, maybe that last bit is not true, but the constant motion, even when it's not blowing air is simply annoying.The search for the perfect heater continues.....Pros:- Quiet- Powerful- Easy to use knob on the top- Provides a fan modeCons:- No ability to select thermostatic control and low power- Thermostat is not calibrated in degrees- Constant motion if oscillation is turned on, even when not blowingRecommendation: Good unit, but for this money it should provide better (and integrated) controls."
david coffman,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good luck if you like to set a temperature instead of just on/off,Verified Purchase,"Update as I near the end of winter.  I reduced my review from 2 stars to 1 star.  This think is the most frustrating heater I've ever owned.  The inability to select a specific temperature, plus the units horrible ability to maintain a given temperature have made me decide to buy a new one later this year for next winter.  The unit is just soooo bad at keeping a specific temperature I can't stand it.  A thermometer I have says 68 degrees.  I tap the heater dial (don't change the dial position) and it heats to 77 degrees before I have to shut it off. I turn the dial to make it stop heating, then turn it right back to where it was (I put a mark on the top so I can align the dial to it) and it get to 68 or lower and doesn't turn on.  WTF.  I hate this thing.  Don't ever by it and don't buy anything from the maker.I bought this to replace a heater that I had for several years that was starting to have issues with the buttons.  Didn't want to risk anything with a product like this so bought this replacement.Pros:  Puts out heat very quickly  Very quietCons:  Variable temperature is poor at best - no numbers and not consistent  Oscillation switch location  Power light remains on unless unplugged  Oscillation rangeSo it is very quiet and I like that a lot.  It puts out heat quickly and warms my home office faster than my last (which also cost less and was smaller).I don't use a heater to blow warm air constantly, regardless of the room temperature.  I prefer to set a temperature that I'm comfortable with and let the unit come on/off as needed.  This has no temperatures on the variable control dial.  The product description says that, so can't say I wasn't warned.  I thought it would be easy to figure out where I like it and put a sticker on the dial so I know where to set it every day.  I got close, but every morning when I turn it to the mark, it heats above.  So I moved the mark to a lower temp (I moved it about 3/16 of an inch.  Then it heats to 2-3 degrees cooler than I want.  I just can't get it to heat to the temp I want.  So I wait until a thermometer in my office reads the desired temp and nudge it down to the lower mark.  When it comes back on as the room temp lowers, it heats way above where it was before.  Today, it heated to 7 degrees warmer and was still going when I realized it and turned it down further.  So not consistent at all.  It will require you to make adjustments during the day or settle for a cooler or warmer temp than you really wanted.As for the oscillation, it only covers about 30 degrees of range!  My old heater did more like 100-120 degrees.And the on/off, fan, temp controls are on the top, but the oscillation switch is all the way down at the bottom of the back.  Why?  What a silly design.  And when you turn it off at the top, it keeps oscillating unless you also turn off the oscillation switch.  Poor design in my opinion.  Why allow oscillation to continue when the fan is not blowing cool or warm air?I'll use it because I'm not going to spend more money on a heater that better fits my expectations, but I wanted to let potential buyers know about what I see as drawbacks.  If you just want to turn it on and have it keep heating regardless of room temperature, this is a good unit.  Otherwise, keep looking.  Wish I had."
Angel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Need different remote control,Verified Purchase,"I love the fan. It's very slender and not too bulky. I am a light sleeper, but I can sleep with this fan on at night with no issues. There is one thing I hate about this fan and that's the remote. It appears that my tv remote controls the fan as well. So if I turn the tv up, the fan started to swing. If I change the channels on my tv, the speed of the fan changes. This is extremely annoying."
Ismael Vasquez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Space Heater,Verified Purchase,"This space heater is very nice because I use it to heat up my room whenever I go to sleep. Even using the heater for 20 minutes in a closed room and opening the door, I can feel the temperature difference right away going into the hall. It can be used as a regular fan as well but I think compared next to an actual fan that was made to blow air, it might fall a little behind but hey this is a space HEATER not a COOLER.My only gripe is that the Automatic Thermostat doesn't work as I had hope it did. I thought that it would heat up the area/room until it's internal Thermostat detects that a room is a certain temperature, stops, then turns back on  when it detects the below desired temperature. When I have this below the middle, it doesn't seem to stop and when i wake up, my room feels like the heater wants the room to be at 85f and there is no indicator anywhere about it. I also tested this out by having the heater stop by turning the thermostat  to a lower level, wait an hour and lower it even further and the heater doesn't turn on automatically. I guess it's meant to be either ""do you want the room to be hot or the heater off?"" modes."
AmazonCustomer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer BEWARE!,Verified Purchase,"This heater worked ok until it STOPPED WORKING altogether about 2 months after I purchased it.Although the safety feature is useless - I had to practically turn the thing upside down in order to get it to “auto” shut-off, it did put out heat fairly well until it just decided to quit working at all.Given that it was too late to return the heater to Amazon by then, I had to deal with the manufacturer at that point.That’s when my REAL PROBLEMS began!I was given an 800 # that actually rings through to China, was finally able to get a 909 area code # for the company’s US HQ in CA, left numerous unreturned voicemails until I was finally able to get a “representative” there who answered the phone.Then the games began:Constant and useless email exchanges until I finally received a written “guarantee” for a full refund for a product that was allegedly out of stock when Amazon was still selling the same model.My guess is that the company that made the piece of junk didn’t want to send me a replacement piece of junk because the rep knew that he’d be hearing from me about it again.There are companies that will avoid dealing with their responsibilities in the hope that a good percentage of us will just give up and wind up being royally ripped off!The “promise” of a refund with due by date was not kept, so I finally called Amazon because I was no longer willing to be BS’d by the manufacturer.Fortunately, a very nice Amazon supervisor stepped in and issued a refund from Amazon, given that I’m a good customer and have a Prime membership.If you buy this heater you might get “lucky” and have it still working past the 90 warranty period.Otherwise, you’ll have to fight like hell to get help.Regardless of the the discounted price - I have to wonder if the price came down while it was still way cold in many parts of the US and Canada because there were many people who had problems with this heater.......at this time of the year when most of us wont be needing much heat until the Fall chill returns in October or November, I WOULDN’T take a chance with this one while it sits in your basement, garage or closet turned OFF until you try to use it again long after your 90 warranty has expired.BEWARE of this company called “TrueTech”True? Seriously?!"
Andres P. Nevarez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great slim tower fan,Verified Purchase, A great fan quiet and very stylish
DBW,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hot and Quiet,Verified Purchase,"This space heater is quiet, puts out plenty of heat and is light weight. It has a tip over safety switch that shuts the unit off if tipped over. However, it does have its faults:- The oscillating switch is on the bottom of the back of the unit, cumbersome to get to. In addition, with the switch turned on, the unit oscillates whether or not the fan or heater is turned on. Kind of useless to have a space heater/fan oscillating with no heat or fan. I have since re-wired mine so it only oscillates if the fan or heater is turned on.- The carry handle is near worthless for me, I can only get the very tips of my fingers in it due to it being so shallow. As a result, when I try to pick it up with the carry handle it tilts away from my hand and slips off my fingers. I have to use two hands to pick it up, one to put my fingers in the handle and the other to prevent the unit from tipping over.As a result of these two issues I can only give three stars for a review."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great lightweight heater,with plenty of heat.",Verified Purchase,"When I first saw it, I was disappointed. It was not as tall as I expected. But when I plugged it in, I was no longer disappointed.  Good heat and a good blower."
Yifan Wang,1.0 out of 5 stars,Design flaw and bad quality,Verified Purchase," Conclusion: A good looking, space-saving product but with major design flaw and messy wiring.As you can see from the video, the heater won’t turn on unless I press it down, due to the failure design- tip over protection. It works well on flat surface, but on carpet, due to its lightweight, the body of heater won’t give enough pressure to activate switch under the base. Also, for a product of 70 dollars, I really didn’t expect such messy wiring inside the body. You can directly see the motor, and wires crossing each other, making me question its quality.For the heating part, it is acceptable. It also has cooling fan function, which seems to be redundant. What customers need is heating and company should focus on doing this well instead of adding unnecessary features and ignoring quality control."
Linda Applegate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quiet enough,Verified Purchase,"I pretty like this heater, far away better than the old one I got from the dollar general last year. Those two heaters are not a big difference between Price, but at the quality, this portable heater is quieter than the older one. Also, I like the free choice of heating level design. It is perfectly excellent. Before I make this purchase, I have stopped by a couple of local stores. They're not too many options and product detail. by the way, I really appreciate Amazon. It gave me more choices and provide better products for me."
Ryan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works. But with a caveat.,Verified Purchase,"I love the oscillation, and the heat output is decent. The thermostat is nice too. Also quiet and at a decent price.BUT, it loses 2 stars because it can not be used on any surface that is not EXACTLY level. We are in an older house with some rooms that don't have a perfectly level floor, or sometimes even the floor material itself is not flat. The safety feature it has whereas it will shutoff if tipped over is great, but it's VERY sensitive. Anything past a degree of tilt it shuts off. We ended up having to use coaster(s) and miscellaneous thin objects to lift one side of the heater a quarter inch to a half inch just to get it to turn on; and even then it sometimes shutoff randomly."
Raymond Jann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bedroom,Verified Purchase,"The fan is quiet, controls are easy to use except I wish they were located higher on the fan.  I would purchase again and recommend"
Mums,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Space Heater for a Small Space or a Cold Corner,Verified Purchase,"This heater works very well to provide heat in small spaces or in cold corners, which is where I have mine.  There is a safety feature which is a button on the bottom so that the hear automatically turns off if it should happen to tip over. There is also an oscillating switch if you need or want it.Just one thing, though.  The button didn't work on my carpet, so I got a tempered glass cutting board (This one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003I24FJY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to place underneath it and now it works very well."
Kimberly,1.0 out of 5 stars,Works when it wants to.,Verified Purchase,Out the box It didn't work when I first plugged up but decided to wait and try again later that day and it worked but close to an hour later it was off and wouldn't come on until next day and it lasted thoughout the day and night no problem until next day it shut off and wouldn't come on.. it only works when it wants to. Already trashed the box so return isn't an option. The heater heats up good and warms up the room when it actually does decide to work.
Lori Gulley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this fan!,Verified Purchase,"Living in Southern Florida and walking a dog 3-4 times a day, this fan is awesome!  Coming in and being able to sit down and cool off quickly is a blessing!  This fan is quiet and efficient.  I highly recommend it to any woman who is suffering from hot flashes! It's like having your own personal air conditioner."
Theresa A Gregg,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad tower Heater.,Verified Purchase,"Have Heat up to high, doesn't work very good have to be 1 ft distance to feel any heat. My bedroom is still freezing. I have given it a hour to Heat my bedroom area, no good. I'm going bad to my old Heater, it gets more area warm. I'm very disappointed with this tower Heater. The top knob not sure which one is High Temperature. A little heat comes out a small opening about 8 inches so it's not a true tower Heater. I'm very disappointed! This is a waste of money!"
DOC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great!!,Verified Purchase,"For the money, this little heater gets the job done.. Since our gym went into lockdown, we decided to turn our garage into a gym.. As it turns out, its pretty chilly out there in the morning and this little heater totally takes the edge off. It is in a 10' x 20' single car garage and has no problem getting the temp up to about 70 degrees (F).. For perspective, it lives in the Pacific Northwest with an insulated garage and does very well.. Not sure how well it would work in colder climates, but out here it does just fine.."
MM,4.0 out of 5 stars,Too many switches,Verified Purchase,"The space heater works well, lots of heat. Two small things disappointed us.First the anti-tipping switch on the bottom is not disengaged when standing on our carper, we had to put a book underneath the heater so it would turn on. Second the oscillating feature operates on its own switch independent of the heating switch, so even when the heater is turned off you have to turn the oscillating switch of as well.The unit looks nice and works well with those two exceptions."
BBQ'r,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like it.,Verified Purchase,"Very quite compared to the small cube type. Being tall it warms my sitting area more evenly vs the shorter type. It has a thermostat type function where you turn the knob to a certain point. Once it hits that temperature in the room it is supposed to cycle off then back on. I find it useless because it is a guess as to what temperature you are setting, more trial and error. It also has a switch on the back bottom to allow it to oscillate back and forth. This works independent of the on-off temperature switch so you must turn both off when done otherwise it will swing back and forth until you do. Found this out the hard way.It is more expensive then others but I did like it enough to buy two more for other office staff. One of those came in with a dead fan, turned it on and almost immediately smelt the plastic burning. That one needs to go back."
Mansur,1.0 out of 5 stars,I don't recommend this heater... Better off choosing a different one!,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for a decent heater that would heat my home office and unfortunately this model is not powerful enough... I don't feel the heat unless I am sitting very close to it and even then it does not offer very many settings.. Also be wary that the oscillating function is completely separate switch that you have to remember to turn off! How inconvenient, save yourself the time and choose a different model  :-/"
Gordon Kindlmann,2.0 out of 5 stars,Will oscillate even when not heating!,Verified Purchase,"I have never seen an oscillating space heater like this: there is a switch to turn on/off the back-and-forth oscillating motion, but this is completely unrelated to whether the heater is heating.  After it has warmed an area, it will just sit there, whirring away as it waves back and forth, but not heating.  It is kind of cute but mostly pathetic and also noisier than it needs to be.  Also, the hysteresis loop for the heating is must be much wider than other space heaters I've used; it feels like maybe 10 or 15 degrees F: it will get really cold before it starts heating again, and will get really hot before it decides to turn off.  Would not recommend."
Lavada Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quiet running, easy to see controls",Verified Purchase,"This is a nice heater. Small, blends into any decor. It runs quiet, throws its heat, and best of all for me, the controls are very large, on the top of the machine, and very easy to see and use. Turn the power on in the back, select the heat setting and you are done. Who ever designed the heater and wrote the instructions did a very good job. I am older and the light weight is nice for me to lift. All in All, a very nice product."
Arielle Mangabat,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Little Heater,Verified Purchase,"First of all, I’m surprised by the range of this little guy. Usually when I have heat lamps, they stay really hot in one spot... and then the rest of the room is freezing.Our apartment is really cold, and we don’t have a heater that works. This heater is great for our bedroom, and it’s light weight enough so I can carry it with me to different parts of the apartment easily. It looks very sleek too.Another important factor is that it will immediately shut off if it falls over. I have cats so... yeah.Overall, I’m happy with what I spent on it. Seems solid but don’t expect it to heat up an entire house!"
iankur,2.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible for the price,Verified Purchase,The thing is a piece of garbage. The safety switch  at the bottom is too hard so it doesn’t work on carpeted rooms. The temperature control is terrible- the room varies in temperature by up to 6-7deg Fahrenheit. Even the temperature at which the heater turns on is inconsistent (with the control knob in the same place). Only thing going for it is it’s quiet.
BluBird,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent Heater, highly recommend.",Verified Purchase,"Purchased the Space Heater for Office - 1500W Electric Ceramic Heater Fan Tower January 25 and timely delivery January 27. Have been using every day since, no issues with the lengthy time I have it powered on. I love the color combination Orange and Black it definitely is UNIQUE. It rotates, shuts off when tilted as stated and heats up the room in under a minute. Pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend."
Connie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quiet, efficient, and slim design",Verified Purchase,"This fan is aesthetically pleasing, quiet, slim, and works great. It only makes noise when the oscillation is on and circulates air through my master bedroom nicely. Not the most powerful fan I’ve had but I’m very happy with this purchase."
Aniloly Jimenez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good fan,Verified Purchase,Very good fan. Blows air and cools down my bedroom
Alexis Moore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,Verified Purchase,Love this. I’m very hot natured but everyone else in the house gets cold so it’s perfect for me and cools off a big space very quickly.
Maria,1.0 out of 5 stars,Merchandised was totally damaged in many pieces n was scratched like it was not new,Verified Purchase,Merchandise was cracked and damaged and it looked used had scratches and came in more pieces then it suppose to it was a disaster but it was no problem to return and didn’t take to long to get reimbursed didn’t try to prefer another very bad experience and was soo disappointed when I received the fan
J. Hoyle,4.0 out of 5 stars,Effective little heater - but beware how hot the casing gets!,Verified Purchase,"Effective heater.  I like that it has a safety turn-off in case the tower is knocked over. However, when I grabbed the heater to move it after it had been running for a bit, the casing was incredibly hot to the touch!  I would buy it again, even knowing this, but it would be useful that there was a warning sticker on the tower itself."
Ginger I. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great small powerful heater.,Verified Purchase,"I received this heater a few day ago and it has lived up to all expectations. I read reviews and researched lots of heaters before deciding on this one. It is quiet, puts out lots of heat, it actually is more than I expected. It is a small powerful unit. As stated if you have shag carpeting you have to put something flat for it to set on so the tip over function works well. You will not go wrong with this heater."
Mari T. Zarpour,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY-Broke after only a few times of use!,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this product for my elderly father who is always complaining about how cold he is. He only used it a few times before he left my house. He had indicated that it wasn't working right but I thought it was just him. I went to use it again just a bit ago now that the weather has turned colder, and now it doesn't turn on at all. I guess it's too late for a refund. This is a cheaply made product."
Becky C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Would recommend,Verified Purchase,I’ve had a couple different space heaters before and this is by far the best one so far at its price point. I appreciate the oscillation and it keeps the basement during the middle of winter nice and warm. The different heat settings are nice as well if you want less heat too.
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Makes an annoying noise,Verified Purchase,"Honestly, not the best heater I’ve used. The reason being that when I turn on the swivel, it makes this god awful grinding noise every time it changes direction which is extremely annoying to listen to. Does it put out heat? Yes. I’m going to get one with a remote next time that doesn’t make an annoying noise when I’m trying to sleep or just be alive in general with this thing on."
me,1.0 out of 5 stars,Way too noisy,Verified Purchase,"Noisy!  So noisy. If not for the noise, it would be a great small heater.  The heat seems to work fine so I give it credit for that, but the noise it makes is so darn annoying. I would say it isn’t good for use anywhere but the bathroom because of that."
Patrick Henry,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super quiet fan,Verified Purchase,Love this fan! I can hear an ant walk across the room and be woken up. This is super quiet and just the right amount of airflow to keep me comfortable at night. Highly recommend it to fellow light sleepers who also need air circulation.
Jacster,1.0 out of 5 stars,Quit working after 2 months,Verified Purchase,"I wrote a complaint, was told I would be contacted and my money refunded and nothing happened. Amazon dropped the ball.  It was very warm and worked fine, for the 2 months that it worked. Then nothing...just stopped working. For the price, it should have lasted a few seasons. VERY disappointed in Amazon too."
jenny,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works,Verified Purchase,"I received my heater which will heat a room in my garage that I have turned into my pottery studio.  When I turned it on, I was unsure if it would heat the whole room. Today I went out to see how it was doing and was amazed at how warm the room was. I had to turn the temp down. Temperature here during the night was 28 degrees.  Unit is light and easy to use. Will have to wait to see how much it adds on to my electric bill. Great product."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works fast!,Verified Purchase,"The heat output on this heater is amazing! For such a small mechanism, it delivers a vast amount of heat in a short time. I’ve purchased two other types of heaters prior to this one that are larger and claim to be efficient for larger spaces but they don’t compare to this one by far."
Ed,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good little heater,Verified Purchase,"This heater packs a punch. I wish it had a remote control. The safety switch at the bottom could be designed better, because it does not work well on carpet. Other than that I recommend this heater to heat up the small area. Will see how this heater performs the next few months and Into next year."
MJ3543,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the cost,Verified Purchase,"Used this for the last month and I would have to say I am not impressed for the cost that was paid. The heat out put is warm, but the fan limits how far the heat can travel. Its basically a radiant heater. The plug also gets very warm if its used for a few hours."
Justin A Bame,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,Verified Purchase,I should of believed the reviews. Fan has tape on the back to seal a split in the case fresh out of the box. High is incredibly disappointing. Sure it’s not a top price fan but for the money not worth it. Best part of the fan is the annoying blue lights shut off. But the most annoying thing is the fan changes speed when I turn the tv up! Pay more and buy a different fan!
Love,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing buy little but powerful,Verified Purchase,My room and my master bathroom is really big it’s a good size room and this heater heats up my room and my master bathroom in about 10 minutes I’m anemic and I’m always cold and my children are always hot so I bought this thinking I’d give it a try I really didn’t think it was going to work as great as it does if you’re thinking about getting one it’s well worth the money
ThrifterGifter,3.0 out of 5 stars,Can find better for cheaper!,Verified Purchase,"It's a nice slim designed fan that doesn't take up lots of space, but for the price vs. the quality....I DO NOT recommend buying when you could get a cheaper fan, that's nicer for the price!"
Lena L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Confusing features but keeps a small bathroom quite warm,Verified Purchase,Temperature control is a bit confusing and it's a knob at the top. The overal appliance is an energy vampire and causes short circuits so this is one of the devices you gotta not run with too many  devices all at once.
Carrie Carlson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not liking how it turns off and on and the high heat,Verified Purchase,I had trouble getting it on at first but then I gave it a gentle shake. I do have carpet so that might have been the reason. My other complaint is if you move it over a little I have to turn it back on. I am also having trouble with it running at the higher temperature but if you want a lot of warmth you will like this heater.
J. Stone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Basic, well functioning space heater",Verified Purchase,"I wish this space heater got hotter. I don't understand entirely what the pictures on it represent but it works. The safety feature of it turning off when you pick it up is likely very valuable if it keeps working. Overall it works fine, but I just wish it were hotter."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible item,Verified Purchase,I am irate. The whole point of paying for a refurbished item is to save money. Instead I wasted my time on a defective product when I could’ve just paid full price for an item that does work!!!!!
S. Fisher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great safety feature,Verified Purchase,I bought this to keep my greenhouse warm. I really like the safety feature that shuts it off if it leans or tips. The oscillating feature is great too. Nice steady heat and low energy use.
Dgallo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good flow of heat from a small heater.,Verified Purchase,I bought this heater to accommodate my 96 year old mother in law. Our family room is a few degrees cooler in the winter than the rest of the house. This heater heats the room which is approx. 12' x 26' very well. It's more powerful than I expected. My mother in law loves it. The only issue I have with this heater is that you do not know what the temperature is when controlling the dial to give more or less heating time.  I like that it does shut off periodically when it reaches a certain temperature.
smokyhillcandles,3.0 out of 5 stars,Would Not Turn On,Verified Purchase,Cannot be used on a normal 15 amp household plug.  I plugged into 20 amp kitchen plug and it worked good but that doesn't help with my home office.  Had to return it.
Kerstin B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little heater!,Verified Purchase,"Love this heater!!I do newborn photo sessions at my house in my living room, which I converted into a studio. The problem is that it has very high ceilings, so that room hardly ever gets warm. Obviously with newborns I need the studio to be warm, so that's where this little heater does an amazing job. It does exactly what I need it to do. I also love that it's pretty small. My old one was kinda bulky and took up a lot more room. Definitely a great buy!"
Conner McPhee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Efficient Little Heater, gets the job done",Verified Purchase,"This product was actually much better than my expectations, this little heater stands no taller than a desktop PC and is able to warm a pretty good size area. recently I bought it to heat up a roommates room in the winter, as our heating system in our house doesn't work well.From what I have felt and heard it was beyond expectations, the oscillating feature is really nice for big areas as well.Probably looking to get another one for my bedroom as well."
Catechist,1.0 out of 5 stars,This heater sucks,Verified Purchase,It didn't even make it a month. Im returning this feeling very disappointed. If you pay $75 for a heater your expecting a heater thats good at heating and last more then a month. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Junk in 3 and 6 months,Verified Purchase,Bought two of these. First one stopped working in 3 months. Second one began melting itself and stopped working in six months. Do not buy
LilysLovelyLashes,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay heater,Verified Purchase,I like this heater but I would have liked it to have a timer. The heater does give you shocks when you plug it out as well in which it’s scary
Jennifer J Price,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good overall!,Verified Purchase,"I like this heater, I thought it would taller but it’s my fault for not looking at the measurements of the heater. Also it has to be on a solid surface to work, I tried placing it on my carpet and I thought it wasn’t working but as soon as I placed it on the wood it worked. So now I just placed a book under it so I can have it in my bedroom. Overall works fine and is not very loud, sounds like white noise in the background."
Rapavt,3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t keep our cold dining room warm enough,Verified Purchase,I was hoping this little heater would have a bigger heat punch. It puts out heat but not enough for my cold dining room.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy customer,Verified Purchase,"Absolutely loved this heater. Doesn’t take up much space. No sound and it really works. I bought it for my parents. They have a small studio with no heater. Their studio was very cold in the winter and they needed to layer up. Now with this heater, their studio is nice and warm...no need to layer up anymore. It heats up very well. I highly recommend it."
Shannon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Small but mighty,Verified Purchase,"This small streamlined heater is a great value.  We purchased this for a large reception area in an office space and the heat output is perfect.  For the price, this is a real deal.  I like that the size does not make it an eyesore."
CRS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Heater received didn’t work,Verified Purchase,This product when received just didn’t work properly for me. I had to return the item and ask for a refund. Your outcome may be different but I decided to go with another heater.

scootz,4.0 out of 5 stars,heater,Verified Purchase,"good source of heat.a personal note and oversight on my part.  i had looked at so many and really wanted one with a remote.  this one doesn't have one.  took for granted it did.  however as for performance, it is a good unit."
Leoan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good,Verified Purchase,"A very good heating machine, only after a while, the temperature of the whole room will rise. There are three temperature adjustments for large, medium and small. It does not take up space in the corner of the room. It is small in size but fast in heating. I really like this heating.  machine,"

G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Circulates heat throughout the room.,Verified Purchase,Good value for the price. Safety feature kicks in any time the heater is touched which is a plus. Would buy this item again.
Josue,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall worth it.,Verified Purchase,"This little heater packs a fire punch.Heats up within seconds.Ive read all the reviews on how quiet it is, but in my opinion it's rather loud ay least if you're trying fall asleep and it's on. I think a timer would have been a great feature to this heater aswell."
Myrna Gillespie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor product for money,Verified Purchase,"The heater is very small and although it says it has a thermostat there is no way to set the temp. It is very lightweight and feels very cheap. Maybe a $20  value, definitely NOT $70. I want to return the heater."
Suz Ryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,Verified Purchase,We bought this for a larger space in our basement because the heat has trouble getting down there and it works great! It warms the entire living room area and is also super easy to move from room to room. I love that is oscillates and has a variety of settings not just on or off.

Heather Phillips,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great fan - keeps the air moving,Verified Purchase,I purchased this fan for the attic portion of our house that does not get great air circulation in the summer.  It has really helped in my office space.  I am able to work from home more comfortably and the fan is quiet enough that I don't need to turn it off during important conference calls.  It is sleek and stylish as well.  I have really enjoyed this purchase.
Catherine Gruber,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heats well,Verified Purchase,Heats well. The temperature control knob is a little hard to handle. It does oscillate which is nice and is well constructed.
Leah Mccabe,2.0 out of 5 stars,smaller than expected,Verified Purchase,This didn't do very well in our insulated porch but we love our smaller heaters just fine so we will stick with those.
mary dunn,1.0 out of 5 stars,Puts Out Great Heat,Verified Purchase,"This light weight, compact, easy to use space heater is just what I wanted!  Only drawback is the carrying handle is not really deep enough to allow for easy pick up and carrying."
Andy J. Harrelson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smaller than I thought,Verified Purchase,It was smaller than I thought it was going to be. It does put out great heat and is lightweight. I just wish it was a little taller to better heat a person standing because it only comes up to around knees and I was wanting one maybe to come up to around hips. But its not a bad heater for the price.
summoh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bad design and assembly,Verified Purchase,Didn’t assemble properly. Upper half and lower half didn’t line up. Low quality plastic construction.
C. KC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing the job,Verified Purchase,"It’s very lightweight, smaller and not as ‘substantial’ as expected for the price...however, it certainly kicks out the heat and is warming up our very cold office.  My husband said it’s perfect."
Chris Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just received it,Verified Purchase,"First impression is that it's a simple compact heater that looks pretty nice astatically. Simple controls and the heat output for my situation is outstanding, I'm using it in an office setting almost directly behind me about 3 feet and can easily feel the heat coming in to my space. Auto thermostat seems like it works well initially time will tell.Overall I am liking it for what I need. We'll see about working longevity I suppose."

Siu-Mui Ng,4.0 out of 5 stars,Keep User Manual About the Heater,Verified Purchase,"I like that it provides fast heat quickly once turn on to high heat. I also like that I can select the amount of heat I want and the oscillating function is a plus. However, I don't like the carry handle. It's not deep in enough; it is a little difficult to get a good grip. I like the newer model's carry handle. Overall, I like this heater except the carry handle."
Byron Grace,5.0 out of 5 stars,it really works,Verified Purchase,I like that it light and easy to move around. My office gets quite cold in low tempertures so with the trustech ptc heater it warms my whole office which is about 15x20. I like that i can ajust the heater with one control and let it do its job.
Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,No thermostat,Verified Purchase,It did not shut on and off with the thermostat like I thought it would
lynda,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money and very un stable,Verified Purchase,Tried putting this fan together and did not even get past the connecting to the  base it just would not snap togeIther and of course its plastic so I was afraid it would snap if I forced it. Even the bottom part that was on the chasis was very unstable.  Surely this item was not worth  the money $100.00
Charles Shepard,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very small heater,Verified Purchase,This heater is adequate for a very small room. Maybe a small bathroom
Jasmine Q,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely put out the heat!,Verified Purchase,I bought 2 of these for my kitchen and dining area. I have tile floors and it is cold in the winter time.

David R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job as advertised.,Verified Purchase,"Just got the little guy and it works at heating up the bedroom faster than my portable radiator and without the stink.  The noise from the oscillation is mellow and sleep inducing, so that's not an issue.  The tip over protection works, it stopped when I jostled it accidentally then started right up again when straightened.  It does the job as advertised."

Han,5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful little heater!,Verified Purchase,"The first thing that I noticed after turning it on is how quiet it is, I even went to double-check that it is on. It heats up our living room fairly quick, considering its small size. At this price point, it's totally worth the price!"
docsizzle,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not cold air,Verified Purchase,"Air is not cold or cool. Weak air breeze strength. Not quiet when in quiet mode, imo."
Trail Cam User,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to Use and Effective,Verified Purchase,"We recently purchased a Space Heater for Office - Electric Ceramic Portable Oscillating Space Tower Heater Fan w/Thermostat.  We have used it a few times and my wife loves it.  We plan on using it on our deck this Fall and then once the winter turns too cold, we'll set it in our spare bedroom for our guests to use.  Thanks....Great product."

Michael,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good output,Verified Purchase,It has some settings on the dial that are confusing and you also have to turn the oscillating feature on/off separately from the heat settings. Other than that great heater with good output for the size.
Eric,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great space heater!,Verified Purchase,Disperses heat very nicely! I really like the thermostat feature (other space heaters pump out heat until they melt their own plastic).  I have it next to my desk in my drafty poorly insulated back room and it makes my gaming time nice and cozy!
sharee m.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a great buy,Verified Purchase,Very small and does not heat my large living room. It's also very short.
Jason,5.0 out of 5 stars,efficient heating,Verified Purchase,"in the past, I have bought many space heaters. it not only broke after using continuously but it also used all my powers and had a constant blackout.

Chestout Corey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great office heater,Verified Purchase,Great office heater. I placed It in the corner of my office and everyone feels it when they walk in.  I like it. I wish I would have gotten one that was a little taller. This one does a great job of providing heat to my legs and feet. But in the future I will get one with the same power but taller.

Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very satisfied with this purchase,Verified Purchase,"Centralized heating, one person uses power saving 2, compared with oil Ting, European heater, this can be put under the desk, so that the lower limbs will be very warm, can not wear cotton towing 3, good-looking, the switch is convenient at the top,"

Christy Perando,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great heater!,Verified Purchase,This is an awesome heater.  It pumps out a lot of heat for the size of the unit and has great safety features.  We use space heaters in the winter as it gets very cold here and we don't want to pay a $600 electrical bill.  This unit warms whatever room it's in very quickly.  Will be getting another!
Brittany LaPour,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,Verified Purchase,Ever since buying mine it started making noise when it turns which is kind of annoying but I’m good at blocking it out. Other than that great item.

Luis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great space heater,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to warm up my legs while working at my desk, and it does it wonderfully. You can feel the heat instantly, and it is very quiet.It would be nicer if it had a remote control or at least a timer so I don't have to get up once it is getting too hot, but overall the product does its job, and it does it well."
Cisek,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little heater.,Verified Purchase,Great heater for the money. Definitely heats up a decent sized room. Would recommend for anyone that’s looking for a small heater for a bedroom or office.

alex deherrera,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Heater,Verified Purchase,This heater works very well & has low noise. Heats up the basement  for being a small device. Instructions are very simple. Only downside of it would be that the dial does not turn on the heater until it is half way up the thermostat. It also trips the fuse when there are too many outlets being used in the same room. Otherwise it's a great heater.
Gray Sky,5.0 out of 5 stars,But this one instead of the other.,Verified Purchase,"Awesome item, it heats up really quickly, probably the best one in the same category"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Keeps Me Warm,Verified Purchase,"Perfect for my bedroom so I do not need to heat the entire house. Keeps us warm in a large master. Sometimes, it can get too hot. It does seem to stay on when plugged in. However most fans and similars do the same. Probably a way to adjust with the settings or by reading the manual."
Kevin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value, solid option.",Verified Purchase,"The heater is lightweight and easily transportable. The safety shutoff works best on solid surfaces and is an added benefit to those concerned about tipping or the unit falling and igniting. The unit quickly heats up a medium sized room, but should not be used to heat anything mush larger. The unit is quiet and has a sleek build. No complaints."
Sandra J. Flinchum,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super quiet,Verified Purchase,I love how quiet the fan really is. no need to turn up the television because you got a fan running on high with this fan. Super super quiet A++

Gabi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple and effective heat,Verified Purchase,"I was very skeptic when the heater arrived due to it's light weight as I was used to ceramic heaters.

havva,5.0 out of 5 stars,great little heater,Verified Purchase,It is a great heater for the price. Most important thing is the auto thermostat. It is just turn on and off depends on the settings. The only negative thing is that it does not work on carpet.
Kevin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Could be quieter.,Verified Purchase,Not very quiet in medium and high speeds.
Kyle Kindy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,Verified Purchase,It is quiet…because it doesn’t blow enough air to cool a room…unless that room is a closet.

Dalton Harms,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good heater,Verified Purchase,Nice Heater
Aprilsky,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sleek new look with little air flow,Verified Purchase,This fan is all appearance and no real quality  function with circulating powerful air during Hot Summer months. The noise level and swivel rotation is the only good thing I can say about this unit. The first level is incredibly weak and the third level is a joke! Barely a slight breeze that flows on any of the 1-3 speed levels. Save your money for a Vornado! This Review is from a customer that wants to share an honest opinion and save your money for a much better unit. A new Sleek appearance is what drew me in. I have the unit in my daughter's room as a back up. Luckily her room is cool year round. Read the full description before making a purchase.
mark_716,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good Space Heater,Verified Purchase,"Hi I purchased 2 of these one for each of my kids Room  Their rooms are on the 2nd floor and the heat just doesn't heat well up there so I bought this for the Winter to keep their rooms warm. The space heater does more than a perfect job keeping it warm. Hot even this thing is so powerful and warms the Room of very fast. I like that it has a tip over safety feature in case he gets knocked over. You can set a timer on it and it will shut off on its own which is perfect so you don't have to worry about it . Overall it is a great space heater, I highly recommend."
Sandi Thompson,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE this fan !!!,Verified Purchase,I love this fan … it has so many options … it is on low and I can not hear it BUT can feel it … and it feels so good .. I love that it has the temp on it … love that it oscillates … I am very happy with this fan !!!
K-B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little heater,Verified Purchase,"Ordered this to heat a 224 square foot area ... and it does a good of doing that. Its small footprint doesn't' take up a lot of room and it's quiet. The 2 heat settings allow for adjusting to temperature conditions and the oscillating helps to evenly heat the room. Overall, a good value for the price."
linalambada,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Compact, efficient, and warm!",Verified Purchase,Works great and heats up fast. The only down fall for me is that the electric cord is too short.
dreyelys,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,Verified Purchase,"Didn’t warm nothing,Lost of money, I think my room gets colder instead of warmer.They should really tell you it would only work for under desk heating. It won’t even heat up a bathroom. Waste of money ."

Whitni Ivey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money.,Verified Purchase,Lightweight and strong.
liuandy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mute constant temperature multi-protection electric heater,Verified Purchase,This electric heater is very quiet when working. It can hardly hear the rotating noise. It is very important for quiet sleep. It has a constant temperature function. You don't have to worry about the temperature being too high or too low. The safest is the rollover protection function.  It is very practical for families with children.
David,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells ""slightly odd"" for about an hour but that's just plastic off-gassing.(Otherwise unplug it!)",Verified Purchase,"Works great so far. Heats up a 28ft x 22ft room with a mid sized window nicely. No smell either after the first hour of it running. The anti-tilt shut off works. It works so well that if the heater is not sitting flat on the floor it will keep it from turning on. After about 5 minutes if why won't my new product work I saw the button on the bottom of the heater. It was just stuck enough that the weight of the heater would not push it down at first. I pushed it down with my hand and after a click it began to run. I set it back down and it turned back on with no problems sense.As for the smell it does let off when it first runs, if it smells like burn plastic unplug it and return it for a different one. That only happens if something came loose inside of it and it got stuck to the heater element. Otherwise all plastic will off-gas when heated for the first few times making it smell odd. Should the smell bother you run it in a vented space till the smell goes away.(Took mine about 1 hour)"
huihui,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent designed！,Verified Purchase," When I got this tower fan, OMG!What a fan! I couldn't be more satisfied with it! The design of the fan is so cool that it takes no space at all. The space reserved for the fan in our house is very small, but it is just right! And you can hardly imagine that such a lightweight tower fan can stay so cool for you! The whole family loves it!"
Romantic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Wow...feel the heat,Verified Purchase,"I needed a replacement for a tower heater that we'd had for several years. I got this one because the reviews were good and the features seemed to be what I was looking for. Nothing fancy about this unit, but it certainly puts out the heat. Warms up our kitchen, hallway, foyer, and living room. I haven't turned on the heater in the living room since starting use of this one. Nice!"
Emily,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smooth and quiet! Love it!!!!!,Verified Purchase,"I love this tower cooler fan, it’s so quiet and smooth!Make me feel so relax while I resting. The weather is getting hot lately so I wanted to buy a fan last month, I have tried the other one before, but the wind of that fan was super loud and it’s noisy make me couldn’t sleep all the time. So finally...... I decided to buy another one, after searching, I have chosen this one. The wind is very cool and very quiet, my dog and I can finally get a good night's sleep.Strongly recommend it to everyone who cares about their sleeping quality."
Charlene A. Wrighton,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is good. I am happy with it.

Summer L.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t work,Verified Purchase,"Defective and they won’t exchange or return it. It turns on, lights up, swings, let’s me press all the buttons, BUT NO AIR COMES OUT.
