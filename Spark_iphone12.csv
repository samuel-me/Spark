Luis Villalobos,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Seller!,Verified Purchase,"iPhone 12 PRO arrived in 2 days! Device is LIKE NEW LITERALLY, It's unlocked, battery at 100%. Recommended 101%"
Thien,4.0 out of 5 stars,alright phone for that price,Verified Purchase,like they said fully unlocked yes it is fully unlocked andits great for me. The battery was a 7/10 but so far its pretty good and whoever said all these comments are all not real then they're mad maybe something happened with their phone but mine its perfectly fine
Sasha-Gayle Douglas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommend,Verified Purchase,It’s dope it’s perfect it’s came fully unlocked I got to put my SIM card inI’m in love with it delivered faster than it said.
schadrack waba,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product looks old and damage,Verified Purchase,The only mistake a made it was to buy this old use iPhone listed as renewal. I don’t want you to make that mistakes . I would buy a new iPhone somewhere else instead of this oldest used iPhone  one listed by that sceller.
Barbarian,1.0 out of 5 stars,Will be returned !!! PLEASE READ,Verified Purchase,Although i really liked the phone which clearly says (RENEWED PREMIUM) i noticed on the order details it says (NEW) and because of that the warranty (Replace/Refund) was not showing 1 year for premium renewed products instead it was showing 90 days! Really upset about that and tried to call Amazon to resolve the issue and ask them to make the changes to reflect what i bought they failed to do so!! I am returning this and placing a new order and hoping this time it wont be an issue as if i am being charged premium price i expect i get premium service
Jennifer T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect refurbished phone,Verified Purchase,This phone would have been perfect had it been unlocked for my use with ATT. It was in perfect condition and so flawless. I’m sick that I couldn’t keep it. Whoever has Verizon will love this particular device. Truly a beautiful phone.
Diana-Crystal Ly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Verified Purchase,"It’s in great condition, I haven’t had anything go wrong with it"
James,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really great phone!,Verified Purchase,"This is a great iPhone, although the battery life is not the best. It is still really great phone I especially like the face unlock"
Nicklaus,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a new used phone,Verified Purchase,"Came in a Amazon renewed box, came with after market charger and cord, the phone was clean looked brand new runs like a new iPhoneOnly complaint was the screen protector it was shipped with was dirty and wasn’t even on the phone but luckily there were no scratches"
Grayson Carter,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good,Verified Purchase,Didn't want to pay for a new device so I figured why not try the renewed. The device looks new and came free of any previous user data. It came with 90% battery health which doesn't really matter to me. I'm not sure how many hours screen on time I will get as I've only had it for a few days but so far hasn't died at any time. The charger and cable they ship with it are not good as the cable can't sync with itunes and the charger is very low power but you can pick up both for very low cost pretty much anywhere
degrab,5.0 out of 5 stars,EASE OF USE AND TRIPLE CAMERAS & VIDEO CAPABILITIES,Verified Purchase,"IPHONE 12 PRO EASY FOR BEGINNERS TO USE. HAD ASSISTANCE SETTING UP AND TRASFERING DATA FROM OLD PHONE SAMSUNG J7 WITH HELP OF SALES REP AT LOCAL T-MOBILE STORE. 99% OF PROGRAMS, DATA AND PHOTOS WERE TRANSFERED. ONCE COMPLETED TRANSFER, CUSTOMIZING TO MY PERSONAL SETTINGS WAS FAIRLY EASY. PHONE IS VERY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD. MUCH LOUDER THAN MY OLD PHONE. SCREEN MAKES TEXTING EASIER TOO AS LETTERS AND NUMBERS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR MY FINGERS. SCROLLING IE FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE, ECT. IS REAL SMOOTH. PICTURES ARE EXCELLENT IN THE PHOTO ALBUMS. YOU CAN ALSO EDIT PICTURES IN THE ALBUM A HUGHE PLUS. THE THREE CAMERAS ARE EXCELLENT AS WELL AS THE PORTARIT MODE AND THE VIDEO. VIDEO IS SO LIFE LIKE AND THE COLORS ARE FANTASTIC. THE NIGHT VIEW WORKS BEAUTIFULLY AS THE PICTURES COME OUT LIKE THEY WERE SHOT IN DAYLIGHT. I BOUGHT THE IPHONE 12 PRO RENEWED. BATTERY LIFE WAS 96% AND I FOUND NO SCRATCHES, DENTS OR DINGS. IT WAS JUST LIKE A BRAND NEW CAMERA OUT OF THE BOX. IT DID HAVE DIFFERENT CHARGING CABLE AND POWER BLOCK WHICH WERE APPLE CERTIFIED. I HAVE HAD THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS NOW AND I LOVE THIS PHONE. THIS IS MY FIRST IPHONE AND THE BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD BUT COULD BE BETTER IF IT HAD A BIGGER BATTERY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE AND I DON'T THINK YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED."
Daniel Olivares,5.0 out of 5 stars,iPhone is iPhone. Good and reliable. And secure!,Verified Purchase,"Love the phone. Been wanting it since it came out and finally put some money together to buy it. I do must say I’m happy to be back with iPhone. I was stuck with a Motorola G4 for almost a year and a half and that phone took a beaten and I finally got tired of it lagging and been a bit of an annoyance to navigate. This phone is clean, sturdy, and very well put together. Love the cameras, I blew my friends mind when I showed him it could take pictures in the dark on SELFIE mode. Even for a refurbished phone it still looks brand new, no dings nor scratches. Looked very clean and smooth when I unwrapped it. And yea unwrapped it. Would’ve prefer getting the whole “brand new fresh off the box” experience. But I’m not complaining. They secured it pretty well. Package might not be filled with bubble wrap but this phone is durable. All they needed was to wrap it around with some foam and the phone got to me in one piece, looked brand new. Didn’t even have to squint my eye I swear.Side note I didn’t put a rating on the finger print because I do not know whether this phone has one. I haven’t bothered the face recognition is enough. It won’t rwcognize your face with a mask on (obviously) but it does recognize from all kinds of angles. Literally even as far as your arms can reach. I’ve gotten myself an Apple Watch lately the 7 specifically and they go hand in hand love them both. I’ve had the phone for 4 months now and it still looks brand new, I still take it out of the case and feel it. I did spent a grand on it, which for a lot of people it is pretty pricy but so far I haven’t had a complain or a regret for buying a thousand dollar phone. Which was a HUGE thing before I bought it. Maybe it’s because I’m finally back with iPhone money doesn’t matter if you’re happy really.Camera is crisp btw."
dalila r.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max. I received an iPhone 12 Pro. Terrible mistake.,Verified Purchase,I received another article. It was a fraud.

Carlos Velazquez,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's fraud by name,Verified Purchase,Totally a fraud by the name is a hoax thinking that you are going to give you an iPhone 12 pro max but the iPhone 12 pro ends up coming
Roberto Espinoza,1.0 out of 5 stars,TRASH,Verified Purchase,"Worst purchase, will have to return. Refurbished is no good. Bad battery, no face recognition. Definitely need the money back."
Petr Fursov,1.0 out of 5 stars,bad,Verified Purchase,bad
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,wouldnt buy- go to the store and get it,Verified Purchase,ive had so many issues with this phone so i am sending it back- keeps randomly shutting off and disconnecting my internet.
Katrina Harland,5.0 out of 5 stars,2nd one is perfect,Verified Purchase,I returned the 1st one due to screen color but reordered from the same company & the 2nd one is flawless. Still waiting on my refund for 1st one but assuming there will be no issues there
PeteSut,1.0 out of 5 stars,Brightness malfunction,Verified Purchase,"This is the refurbished phone I got from Digital Age USA, with brightness turned up all the way. Impossible to read. This is equivalent to the brightness turned to the lowest setting on my other iPhone. Sending it back for a refund. I wasn't sure if it was possible to troubleshoot this issue so I called Digital Age USA, but despite claiming they have a ""dedicated customer service staff available 8:30 - 6:30 CST/ 7 days"" no one picked up the phone after 2 attempts during those hours. Instead, I  was greeted by a recorded message telling me to send an email via Amazon returns."
Crystal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worthless,Verified Purchase,"Very bad, worthless."
Dcube,1.0 out of 5 stars,BEWARE,Verified Purchase,"The phone looks great except for near the charging port where there was a ton of scratches. This phone has a lot of static noise in it. The callers on the other end constantly complain that they cant hear me and its a lot of background noise and at other times, no sound. I can hear them fairly clearly but they have all sort of issues hearing me. This is my second purchase since the first one had cracks on the screen. Dont be like me, make sure that if you do purchase, thoroughly test it before sending it off to Canada as a gift! Save yourself the disappointment and expenses. Avoid these and just put the extra mone and buy from apple refurb or buy New if you can. Take my advice"
nubia cordero,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad product,Verified Purchase,So bad product and seller
ALucy,4.0 out of 5 stars,The item seems to be in good shape. I only returned because of the payment method appied,Verified Purchase,   
ANTONIO P. GOUDEAU JR.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not as advertised,Verified Purchase," I actually like the phone and often buy renewed electronics from Amazon. I purchased this phone and everything works except the fact that there is a separation in the upper left hand corner of the phone that could possibly compromise the water resistance of the phone. The phone is sold as renewed with minor imperfections, but this is a major imperfection that could compromise the life of the phone. For the price I paid, I don’t see the value when I have to deal with these types of issues. As I have said before, I have bought other phones from the Amazon Renewed program and have never has a problem. In this situation I have given the seller the same information that I’m sharing here and they are giving me “the run around”. I only want a replacement for the phone as I need it for work. Unfortunately, I’m unable to currently reach that goal"
Anthony Apodaca,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Quality for a Refurbished Product,Verified Purchase,"When unboxed, the phone was flawless. I couldn’t see any faults, micro scratches, or chipping. I love that it was available for a steep discount compared to what my carrier was offering and I’m enamored with 5G connectivity. I’m super stoked about keeping a great device out of a landfill. 10/10 would recommend !"
Dan R,5.0 out of 5 stars,Returned because of defect.  Amazon took it back with no question. I am a happy guy.,Verified Purchase,"I was trying to save some money by getting a used phone.  The phone was in great condition, and looked like new, until I found that the Bluetooth didn't work.  It's a great phone, but I really use the Bluetooth a lot, so there was no question that it had to be returned.  Amazon gave me no hassles, and I am a happy guy.  I finally gave up the idea of a used phone, and just went out and got a new phone.  Yes it was expensive, but it should last a long time."
jonnathan perez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best phone i ever had,Verified Purchase,The face recognition is amazing battery life is at 100% and the touch screen is amazing. i was alittle skeptical at first but now that i have this iphone in my hands i can honestly say that it was a great buy and a great deal. Honestly would buy again if i ever need to !!!!!
brittany,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing just like new,Verified Purchase,This phone is awesome coming from using an iPhone 7. Takes a few mins to update when you first receive (more like 5 hours) but once it’s booted up it’s great! I love this phone and the shipping was super fast.
Shirley,1.0 out of 5 stars,Improvements required on the quality of the phone,Verified Purchase,"Unable to start and close the phone. As the price was expensive, its quality and package were not satisfying. It was an awful experience."
Shahin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,Verified Purchase,Had 100% battery. Thank you sir
Bony Laurent,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Verified Purchase,"Awesome iPhone, came like new, no to not visible scratches. I got it connected right away with my provider without any problem. Face recognition, extraordinaire. Battery life, pretty descent to handle all those features and last about 24 hours. Great technology is expensive, so, the price is acceptable for an item that is  almost perfect."
Jorge Correa,1.0 out of 5 stars,,Verified Purchase,
Juvien86,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend,Verified Purchase,Just got my phone and it came exactly how I expected. Battery 90%! Completely unlocked because I live in Aruba! Just out my sim in and readyyyy!One minor scratch but you have to look really hard to find it. I guess I’m luckySo happy I bought it!
Brandon J,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great Renewed IPhone. Poor Battery Life,Verified Purchase,"The phone works great beyond the battery life. When I first got it, I noticed an easily drained battery. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, let it charge and used my old phone for the day.Fast forward 72hrs later, the battery life is better but not still draining easily after it drops below 80%. Thankfully I reached out to Amazon and they are sending me a replacement (thank you!)Hoping my Asurion warranty will work on my new replacement and not just this iPhone with the poor battery life."
Bee,3.0 out of 5 stars,The SIM Tool Missing,Verified Purchase,"No SIM Tool was included with my Iphone 12 Pro package as represented in Amazon. Would appreciate one, rather than using hair pins that can damage the phone."
Myasin1,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for money,Verified Purchase,I bought it and use it for almost 2 months and then this phone start heating up in my pocket I did not even use just in my pocket or just laying down it start to heat up for no reason and shut off be careful full before you buy and yes look for a poolicy which says 3 months return so I’m may case you can return it other wise Amazon coustmer service is great thanks
Dorothy MacAskill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied,Verified Purchase,Love the phone but need insurance.
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Should provide more information on what was renewed on the phone.,Verified Purchase,More Information on working conditions and transparency on major repairs of the phone (such as replacing camera etc).  I found out by chance that major repairs were done to the phone.  Too much emphasis on ‘how’ the phone looks. Had I known in advance of the major repairs I would not have bought the phone. Price difference from new to renewed is too close.
Pedro,4.0 out of 5 stars,Small scratches on the screen,Verified Purchase,I was excited to get the new iPhone and willing to pay the amount it cost but then I take it out of the box it came in and it already had minor scratches on the display and It was really off putting I can’t stop staring at it
Escuela - Salas Family,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived perfect as new,Verified Purchase,Perfect condition battery life 100# excellent investment I recommend this perfect
Alex K.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sprint locked iPhone received.,Verified Purchase,"Received sprint locked iPhone.To check yours go to:Settings -> general -> about,Find line that says “Carrier Lock”.Unlocked phone should say “No SIM restrictions”.Unfortunately the iPhone I received says “SIM locked” and has a large yellow sticker in the back that says “To unlock this phone call sprint at…”"
caesar,1.0 out of 5 stars,This phone is no good,Verified Purchase,"This phone is no good it is getting hot, it has no service bar, i need my money back please"
Pendeza,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow 😮,Verified Purchase, It was great! I was so happy to hold it but then I had a really tough time transferring my files from the previous one to this idk why but other than that! Amazing️️
Richi,2.0 out of 5 stars,Full scratches,Verified Purchase,Not much investment is in perfect condition
Cameron Stanley,1.0 out of 5 stars,No SIM card I used would work.,Verified Purchase,"When I bought this phone I thought I could just transfer my SIM from my old phone to this one and to my surprise it did not work. So I thought ""Okay well maybe I need a new SIM from a new provider?"" Well, I went through Verison, AT&T,  and Straight Talk. And this phone would not work with any of them. So I returned it but now because of a fault with either Amazon or UPS a different tracking number was used and now I can't even get my money that I spent on this back either, just to add more fuel to my anger. Definitely won't catch me buying a ""renewed"" phone from you guys again. Not worth it."
Eva K,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic value,Verified Purchase,"Phone works perfectly, long battery life, face recognition works well. Very happy that I bought it!!"
Val,4.0 out of 5 stars,Look like new,Verified Purchase,"I have bought it for my daughter, the device looks like new and is pretty smooth."
ms james,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,Verified Purchase,"The sellers were amazing and were very helpful when I ad a slight issue. The phone was exactly what you'd expect, no scratches or marks, it was perfect condition in every way. It was delivered quickly and a reasonable price."
Juan Perez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,Verified Purchase,The phone looks like new. Great price. Battery has a 100% maximum capacity. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
Alberto Parra,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Would recommend it, it is certainly not a new phone, and is truly a gamble.",Verified Purchase,"I bought 2 copies, a Blue one and a Space Gray. The blue one arrived with a small scratch on the surface (not on the screen), but with 100% battery capacity. The gray one, arrived in perfect shape (no scratches anywhere) but with 88% of battery capacity.It is what you are buying, a Renewed phone, not new, not used, somewhere in the middle and is certainly a gamble. They both are working perfectly and have no other flaws, i would give the product in general 8 out of 10, and would recommend it."
Rastislav Sivulka,5.0 out of 5 stars,The iPhone 12 Pro working well in great condition Thankyou,Verified Purchase,Excellent
Jason Branch,5.0 out of 5 stars,Like brand new no scratches no scuffs and battery health was 100%,Verified Purchase,No scratches no marks no scuffs and battery health was 100% phone was like brand new…. The only thing that wasn’t up to par is it didn’t come with an original charging block but that’s a very small issue if any issue at all
kugelang,5.0 out of 5 stars,Looks good as New,Verified Purchase,It shipped quickly and came with a charger and cable.  It looks like New.  The battery is at 93%.  I did end up buying the Apple fast charger and a usb c to lightning cable.
Jennifer,5.0 out of 5 stars,IM IN LOVE!,Verified Purchase,For a renewed phone this is awesome! works perfectly no flaws battery is AWSOME! if i could give one piece of advice to the seller 86 FEDEX not the best haha but aside from the that the phone is a 10 out of 10 thank you!!
Shela,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product. Recommended,Verified Purchase," The reviews had me worried and nervous about the iphone but it was all good, excellent product from Trademore. The product arrived before the estimated date. They are using fedex 2 days express delivery and signature are needed. So I received my iphone 12 pro 2 days after I made my payment in Amazon. My phone came in with zero scratches, zero dents, & 100% battery capacity. This felt like a new phone. Would definitely recommend."
Peter Olson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Looks like new!,Verified Purchase,Accurate description of what you are getting.  Like the color and battery life.
Noel Torres,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great and legit!,Verified Purchase,"The product is brand new. Aside from the battery percentage being 87%, it cosmetically has no wear and tear at all, because I assume it had a really good case on it prior. Definitely a great purchase for 700$. The battery being that way does not change anything drastically for the potential trade in value of the phone anyways so if you’re looking in to a renewed phone you should have great luck. If you don’t, return it and simply get different phone and it will be assured quality."
C. Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,It came through. No scratches or problems,Verified Purchase,Good phone just as advertised no issues

Not a single scratch, blemish, dent, or scuff on this phone. I would think all electronics from this seller are in perfect condition. Battery life is 96%"
Anna,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm pleased,Verified Purchase,"I've included photos of how the phone came and a water bottle for size reference. Overall, I'm pleased with my product. It came with a generic charger and surprisingly a SIM card tool opener. The phone arrived in like-new condition and the battery optimization was 92%. I easily transferred the SIM card from my old phone to the new one and set it up with my phone carrier with no problems."
Aron Jackson,2.0 out of 5 stars,Misleading,Verified Purchase,Product description said it was unlocked for AT&T but rather It was unlocked for T-mobile other than AT&T.  What a headache!
Sarah blazynski,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,Verified Purchase,Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she’s been loving it ever since !
Khenny,2.0 out of 5 stars,Still Observing,Verified Purchase,"Phone came fast, battery was on zero and came with flimsy charging cord. Everything else looks good, no scratches, unlocked and battery was at 90% health. But now I've found out it get really really hot when I connect via Bluetooth for carplay navigation. I'll keep for a while and if this continues I'll be returning it."
